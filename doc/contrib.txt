SMAUG is based on Merc 2.1 code, with MobPrograms patched in, (which have
been expanded into "MudPrograms").  All original versions of Merc MUD may be
obtained from: ftp://ftp.game.org/pub/mud/diku/merc/

Merc 2.1 is based on the Copper2 code, which is in turn based on the
Sequent code, which is based on the original DikuMUD Gamma 0.0 code.
All of these code bases are available from ftp://ftp.game.org/pub/mud/diku/

The original mobprograms were written by J Murphy, N'Atas-Ha of ThePrincedom,
murph@cs.cmu.edu.  (Look in the mudprogs subdirectory for the original
distribution).

The Free Software Foundation and DJ Delorie wrote our development tools, and
distribute them for free, with source.  You can ftp them from prep.ai.mit.edu
and grape.ecs.clarkson.edu.

The automated auction code, and the "FOR" command came from Erwin S.
Andreasen, erwin@pip.dknet.dk.  He has many code snippets available from:
http://pip.dknet.dk/~pip1773/ and ftp://ftp.game.org/pub/mud/snippets/Erwin/

The OLC "help" files found in the /doc directory have been contributed by
Herne of Realms of Despair.

The "SMAUG FAQ" was compiled by Altrag, and can also be found in the /doc
directory (FAQ.txt).

Coders Altrag, Swordbearer and Tricops have their roots in "The Abyss",
and likely some of their contributions/ideas have come from their work on
there.


                         === About the coders ===


This is a rough attempt to outline what parts of the code each coder has
worked on.  Keep in mind that this is a ROUGH attempt, which means I'll
likely not be mentioning every detail by any means. :)

(SMAUG1.4 note:  This file was barely update for the new release... I kept
asking all the coders to update their sections... but no one did :(
I added what I could quickly, and hopefully we'll get it up to date for the
next revision.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thoric is the original coder, and did not take on any other programmers
for close to a year after starting his work on the code in summer 1994.
Previous to starting up his own mud, "Realms of Despair", he had played
a mud called "Mozart", which was a highly modified SillyMUD.
He is currently the head programmer for Python Communications, and has
been programming for over 14 years.  His email address is derek@idirect.com.

His main contributions include, but are not limited to the online building
code (build.c), clans (clans.c), adding basic ANSI color support, the
wizlist builder, the original player authorization system, levers, switches,
pullchains, buttons, expanding the mud to 65 levels, (50 mortal, 15
immortal), the new experience system, the complex mobiles, resistances
immunities and susceptibilities, hunting, mobiles hating and fearing,
mounts, pipes, the extended container commands, object grouping, the
extended/advanced exits, delayed room teleports, tunnels, lots of new exit
flags, heaps of new affect types, kill tracking (individual for each
player), new mud economy code, the SMAUGSPELL system, the skill table
loading/sorting/editing system, the command loading/hashing/editing system,
the social loading/hashing/editing system, the class loading/editing system,
the bulletin board system, dual wielding, layered clothing, floorless
rooms/falling, mental-state code, the smart string hashing code (hashstr.c),
projectiles, pulltypes, extended bitvectors as well as countless bugfixes,
minor coding details and many, many speed optimizations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Haus got involved with SMAUG in early 1995 when Thoric was getting less and
less free time to work on the mud.

His major contributions include expanding the mobprograms into mudprograms,
the VT-100 menu based building interface (ibuild.c), the new score command,
the map-based area creator (mapout.c), player comments (comments.c), rank,
weapon proficiencies, fighting styles, as well as many of the new spells.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scryn started coding in the summer of 1995.

He has added many of the popular skills, spells and commands like brew,
scribe, shove and drag, added private mail support (postoffice), councils,
work on clans, some of the new area_data fields, clan storage room saving,
hard/soft area ranges, player homepage field, added luck and support code,
the checkvnums command, and did a major renovation on the login sequence to
make it a lot less confusing for new users, including letting them into a
special area until their name has been accepted by an immortal.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Narn joined the team in the late summer of 1995.

She has done a lot of work on cleaning up the mudprogram code (mud_prog.c),
and has given it the ability to handle nested if/else blocks.  She has done
a lot of bugfixing, code cleaning up, and helping some of the junior coders.
She renovated the who command to be less redundant and more organized, has
done a lot of work with the clans and pkill code, added support for retired
and guest immortals, as well as prefix matching for object and character
names.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Altrag started coding early in 1996.

Has done a lot of major code work including the vnums command, tongues, the
mposet, mpmset mudprog commands (mpxset.c), rewrote mprog_do_ifcheck from a
big mess of redundant code into something nice and clean :), the screen
pager, the configurable prompt code, the inline color codes, the reset code
(reset.c), the command timing/lag detection code, a lot of "safeguard"
coding, the fancier "echo" command, the new owhere command, corpse saving,
hell/unhell commands, ban saving and loading, some work on the RIS stuff,
some skills and spells, as well as the retrans and regoto commands.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Swordbearer started coding in the spring of 1996.

He has done a lot of fixes and adjustments to many existing and new spells, 
some of the mpcommands, added mpinvis (like wizinvis for mobs), the 
augurer class with 4 new spells, the vsearch command, the remove all 
command, and the gag feature for reducing redundant battle text.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blodkai while only recently getting involved with coding, has put a great
deal of effort into making this release possible with his administrative
duties and expertise with area building.

His coding contributions mainly involve lots of tweaking and fine tuning to
the pkill and clan code, as well as the addition of item loyalty and some
new spells.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Gorog is also a recent addition to the coding team and has recently been
doing alot of work.

His work has been on the new, easier to use authorization system, the
diagnose command the grub/grux/ogrub utilities, the watch command, and
numerious ifchecks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rennard is another newbie coder, but has done a lot of work with Thoric on
the SMAUGSPELL system before starting any coding.  He basically did all
the conversion of hard coded spells to the new SMAUGSPELLS.

As far as his coding goes, he as put a lot of work in effort into adding
coded deities, which being a new addition, will likely go through a lot
of development over the next few months.  He also added configurable reset
messages, the dig and bury commands, some new sector types and some work on
the pkill code.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tricops while being on the coding team for several months, has not had the
time to do a great deal of work.

His coding has mainly involved tweaking and fixing, as well as some work on
the projectile code (mainly the scan command).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grishnakh has also been on the coding team for a long time, and similarily
has not had the time available to do much coding.

He added the doorbash skill, installed Erwin's "FOR" command, as well as
a few other minor code additions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nivek is currently the head of the coding council, and has done a tremendous
amount of work on the code over the past few months.  This includes
countless optimizations and bug fixes, and also without his work, SMAUG1.4
would not have gotten out for several more months.  His other major
contributions include the new polymorph code (polymorph.c) , the nuisance code,
the ban code (ban.c) , the immhost code (immhost.c), fighting prompts and new 
variables in the prompt code, ipcompare code, pet saving code,  multiple level 
ranges in pkill for clans, boards code was updated to show dates and have the 
ability to give special messages when you use the board,  minor additions to 
the who code, the cook skill, rewrote the dispel magic spell, added lots of 
new ifchecks and mpcommands, changed races and classes to be easier to add new
ones online, plus many other things that have yet to be added to this list.
