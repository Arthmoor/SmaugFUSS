InfoXXX configuration
---------------------

This file describes various parameters that can be set in the IMC config file
(normally imc/config)

First, two lines are REQUIRED in your config file before IMC will start up:

- InfoName <full name of mud>
  This should contain the full name of your mud. It can contain spaces, etc.

- InfoEmail <contact address>
  This should contain a valid email address for the person on your mud who is
  responsible for maintaining IMC there.

Optional lines. These will be used (once I write the code :) to automatically
generate a list of muds on the IMC network. Consider it a free, automatic
mud listing service.

- InfoImail <contact address>
  The IMC name (user@mud) of the contact person for IMC matters.

- InfoHost <host:port> 
  REQUIRED field.
  The host and port information for the mud itself (not the IMC port)
  If you are not running 1.03, or above, do not put the port address on this 
  line.

- InfoWWW <url>
  The URL to the mud's webpage, if any.

- InfoDetails <text>
  A brief description of the mud. This should describe the theme, basically;
  if it turns into "This mud is kewl!!!!!!" then I'll just take it off the
  list.

- InfoFlags <flags>
  A list of (space-separated) flags. Currently, two flags are defined:
     hide   : hide the mud from normal imclist. Used for test ports,
              build ports, etc.
     nolist : do not put this mud on the auto-generated list. This is implied
              if you specify hide.
