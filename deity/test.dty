#DEITY
Filename		test.dty~
Name		Test~
Description	Test, Deity of the Vampire, bares his pearly white fangs in pleasure as
his followers drain the blood of their foes. Test praises his vampires
for the use of their gothic spells while in combat, and delights in seeing them
drain the blood of fallen foes. Created by Vl'arescht to rule over the evil
Vampire, Test has adapted to the changing way of the vampire and honours
the neutral and good-aligned vampires as well as his evil followers.  Believing
that the Vampire should be the only un-dead, immortal class, Test hates the
gods and their representations.
