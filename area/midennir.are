Desc     The darkened trail comes to an abrupt stop at this point. Floating all about
is an overshadowing sense of loss. There seem to have been rose bushes on
the sides of the path. They all have been trampled and now drip with blood.
You can only hope that whatever horrors took place here do not soon return.

on the western wall of the attic.

nearby rush of what sounds like a large river can be heard, though you
can't seem to see it from here.  You can climb up to the bridge from
this spot, though from the looks of it the narrow passage upward would
be too precarious to enable you to make it back down.
