don't usually get the best accomodations, but this is ridiculous.  The whole
room is virtually empty, except for a small straw mat and a cabinet, and
underneath your feet is clay;  the poor servants don't even have a floor to
their house.  Poorly built walls have no chance of keeping any heat within
the shack, and the windows aren't even windows; they're small squares cut in
the wall covered with animal skin.  Above you is a straw roof, which has
