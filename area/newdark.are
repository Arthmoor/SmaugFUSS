ExDesc       The Legend of the Parchment
 
During the excavation for New DarkHaven, a chest of weapons and artifacts
was uncovered, was concluded to have originated with an ancient clan of
pkillers...
 
All the weapons of this clan with shiny metal surfaces had been covered
by black tar.  The conclusion was that the clan had attempted to avoid
detection in sunlight by preventing the blades of their weapons from
reflecting the sun's rays.
 
Because of this, it is believed the clan was known as the Black Knives,
of which the only references to them now is in the lore of the Bards.
 
Hidden among the weapons and artifacts was a set of tattered parchments,
which upon translation, appeared to be training material written by an
ancient pkiller.  Although some of the information is now obsolete,
the relevant portions were transcribed and made available in the
parchment you now hold...

ExDesc       Three Important Suggestions
 
1.)  If possible, turn on your "capture session" capability.  This will
help you improve your performance by reviewing your failures and your
opponents tactics.
 
2.)  Some kind of macro facility is recommended.  Depending on your typing
speed, this may be more important to some players than others.  In general,
if one player uses macros and another does not, the player using macros
has a distinct (speed) advantage.
 
3.)  This game is a social place.  Players who share info with other
players tend to do much better than solitary players.  The information here
is intended to be sparse.  To fully understand the items discussed here, it
is wise to talk the things mentioned here over with other players.

ExDesc       Preparation is the foundation to success.  A weaker player who is prepared
will often defeat a stronger player who is not.  Preparation includes being
shielded and having your weapons wielded at all times when you are not in a
safe place.  It also means having the spells you need and being able to
quickly regenerate a shield or spell if it wears out.
 
You must carry scrolls, potions and other objects that will give you spells
and heals and you must be prepared to get them and use them instantly.  This
means you have to carry some in your inventory and some in containers.  You
need to have macros set up to get them and use them.  If you do not use
macros, you need to know which items are stored in which containers so you
can get them instantly.  When attacked by surprise, you cannot afford to
start fumbling around hunting for supplies -- you will likely die.
 
How do you get all these scrolls, potions and other items?  Well, mages and
clerics can brew potions and scribe scrolls of any spell for any player.  If
you do not have a mage or cleric, you'll need to co-operate with other
players to learn where to buy them or how to find other equivalent objects.

ExDesc       Area Knowledge
 
Area Knowledge is important to survival whether engaging in pkilling or mob
killing.  You should try to learn as much about an area before attempting
to operate in it.  Know nearby safe zones and where you can or cannot
recall from.  This knowledge may save you in the future.

ExDescKey    4a~
ExDesc       Dealing with Immunities
 
Some players and mobs are immune to different types of weapons and spells.
It's a good idea to carry a few different kinds of weapons and be prepared
to use a few different kinds of offensive spells.  It is important during a
fight to try and see if your weapons and spells are doing any damage.  If
your weapon is constantly "missing" (not dodged or parried, but missing),
be ready to switch to another weapon.  If your fireball constantly misses,
try a different kind of spell.  There are many, including lightning bolt,
burning hands, color spray, energy drain and many others to choose from.
 
 
Avoiding Death Traps and Other Nasty Surprises
 
When you are in an unfamiliar place, it is a good idea to look ahead before
entering a new room.  Use scry or scan to do this.  If you see a room that
has no exits, you need to be cautions because it might be a death trap.  If
you cannot scry or scan, type "look direction" and read the description of
what lies in that direction.  Most of these rooms are not death traps, they
just have exits that are not obvious or require you to recall to exit.  One
good technique is to bring a friend or a character with little equipment
and send them in to test for a death trap.  Having friends in the mud pays
dividends in many ways.

ExDesc       Disarm
 
If you can disarm an opponent and take their weapon, you can get a great
advantage.  This tactic is a little over-rated because your opponent may
have a good grip on their weapon or may have extra weapons.  The effort
you put into disarming them takes away from other tactics you should be
using instead.  Disarming mobs can sometimes be a bad move because some
mobs hit much harder when disarmed.  If you must try this skill, perhaps
you should try it only once or twice in a fight and then move on.
 
 
Backstab
 
If you can backstab an opponent to start a fight, you should certainly try
it.  In order to be backstabbed, however, an opponent must be at full hit
points.  If they never eat or drink (a good tactic against backstabbing),
they will always be a few hp below maximum.  You can always start a fight
by healing your opponent in the hopes of bringing them to full hit points,
then backstab them.  Naughty but Nice!

#ENDEXDESC

#EXDESC
ExDescKey    6~
ExDesc       Config +FLEE
 
Many players like this until they flee into a death trap.  In general, it's
a bad idea.  You are usually better off to recall than to flee.  If you have
problems recalling, as a last resort, you can try teleport.
 
 
Miscellaneous Tidbits
 
The susceptibility spells, (Razorbait, Swordbait, Winter Mist, Blazebane,
Ethereal Funnel) and the resistance spells, (Dragonskin, Demonskin, Inner
Warmth, Blazeward, Ethereal Shield) are of lesser value and you should
probably not trouble yourself with them until you have mastered all other
aspects of combat and strategy.  Suscpetibility spells may be useful when
fighting a known mob that takes a long time to defeat, as they tend to
reduce the time somewhat.  Spells like Eldritch Sphere, Antimagic Shell,
Shadowform and Valiance are also best left for specialized uses.
 
There are also some miscellaneous skills which are best left for specialized
use - (kick, punch, bash, circle).  Circle appears to be a wonderful skill,
but there are problems with it.  It only works in certain circumstances and
it locks you out (lags the circler) for a round or two.

  Quick is the one who steals for me,
  Charming, bold, confuses many,
  Luck with the one who escapes me,
  Dead be my foe, my enemy.
 
-Lord Rennard, March 1996
 
I'd like to say thanks to Thoric for creating and maintaining an
excellent mud, to Dominus for some amazing administrative work,
to the coders for all the unique gadgets, to the builders for
creating a lush game world, to the immortals for upholding the
law and to the players for making it all worth it.
 
I would also like to extend a special thanks to Haus, who provided
an enormous supply of ideas through the original new DH, and to
Blodkai, for endless insight and support.

The walls all around you are made of stained glass, rather than the granite
in the hall, allowing the sunlight from the realms into this room.  A light
humming and singing can be heard in this spacious room, and the sweet smell
of jasmine is predominant here.  The Augurer is a very spiritual person,
and relies on meditation and reflection upon the day's activities in order
to be a productive citizen in the community.  Sculptures and handicrafts of
the Augurer lie in this room in a state of order, yet in a state of chaos
as well, showing the strengths and weaknesses of the Augurer's mind.
