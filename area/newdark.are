The Legend of the Parchment
 
During the excavation for New DarkHaven, a chest of weapons and artifacts
was uncovered, was concluded to have originated with an ancient clan of
pkillers...
 
All the weapons of this clan with shiny metal surfaces had been covered
by black tar.  The conclusion was that the clan had attempted to avoid
detection in sunlight by preventing the blades of their weapons from
reflecting the sun's rays.
 
Because of this, it is believed the clan was known as the Black Knives,
of which the only references to them now is in the lore of the Bards.
 
Hidden among the weapons and artifacts was a set of tattered parchments,
which upon translation, appeared to be training material written by an
ancient pkiller.  Although some of the information is now obsolete,
the relevant portions were transcribed and made available in the
parchment you now hold...
 
~
E

Three Important Suggestions
 
1.)  If possible, turn on your "capture session" capability.  This will
help you improve your performance by reviewing your failures and your
opponents tactics.
 
2.)  Some kind of macro facility is recommended.  Depending on your typing
speed, this may be more important to some players than others.  In general,
if one player uses macros and another does not, the player using macros
has a distinct (speed) advantage.
 
3.)  This game is a social place.  Players who share info with other
players tend to do much better than solitary players.  The information here
is intended to be sparse.  To fully understand the items discussed here, it
is wise to talk the things mentioned here over with other players.

Preparation is the foundation to success.  A weaker player who is prepared
will often defeat a stronger player who is not.  Preparation includes being
shielded and having your weapons wielded at all times when you are not in a
safe place.  It also means having the spells you need and being able to
quickly regenerate a shield or spell if it wears out.
 
You must carry scrolls, potions and other objects that will give you spells
and heals and you must be prepared to get them and use them instantly.  This
means you have to carry some in your inventory and some in containers.  You
need to have macros set up to get them and use them.  If you do not use
macros, you need to know which items are stored in which containers so you
can get them instantly.  When attacked by surprise, you cannot afford to
start fumbling around hunting for supplies -- you will likely die.
 
How do you get all these scrolls, potions and other items?  Well, mages and
clerics can brew potions and scribe scrolls of any spell for any player.  If
you do not have a mage or cleric, you'll need to co-operate with other
players to learn where to buy them or how to find other equivalent objects.
 
(Type look 3A for Area Knowledge)
 
~
E
3a~
Area Knowledge
 
Area Knowledge is important to survival whether engaging in pkilling or mob
killing.  You should try to learn as much about an area before attempting
to operate in it.  Know nearby safe zones and where you can or cannot
recall from.  This knowledge may save you in the future.

Spells and Skills
 
The following is a list of spells and skills that you should understand and
be able to use:
 
Shields        - sanctuary, iceshield, fireshield, shockshield.

Defensive      - armor, bless, shield, stone skin, protection, heal, invis.

(Look 4A for Dealing with Immunities and Death Traps)
 
~
E
4a~
Dealing with Immunities
 
Some players and mobs are immune to different types of weapons and spells.
It's a good idea to carry a few different kinds of weapons and be prepared
to use a few different kinds of offensive spells.  It is important during a
fight to try and see if your weapons and spells are doing any damage.  If
your weapon is constantly "missing" (not dodged or parried, but missing),
be ready to switch to another weapon.  If your fireball constantly misses,
try a different kind of spell.  There are many, including lightning bolt,
burning hands, color spray, energy drain and many others to choose from.
 
 
Avoiding Death Traps and Other Nasty Surprises
 
When you are in an unfamiliar place, it is a good idea to look ahead before
entering a new room.  Use scry or scan to do this.  If you see a room that
has no exits, you need to be cautions because it might be a death trap.  If
you cannot scry or scan, type "look direction" and read the description of
what lies in that direction.  Most of these rooms are not death traps, they
just have exits that are not obvious or require you to recall to exit.  One
good technique is to bring a friend or a character with little equipment
and send them in to test for a death trap.  Having friends in the mud pays
dividends in many ways.
~
E
5~
Disarm
 
If you can disarm an opponent and take their weapon, you can get a great
advantage.  This tactic is a little over-rated because your opponent may
have a good grip on their weapon or may have extra weapons.  The effort
you put into disarming them takes away from other tactics you should be
using instead.  Disarming mobs can sometimes be a bad move because some
mobs hit much harder when disarmed.  If you must try this skill, perhaps
you should try it only once or twice in a fight and then move on.
 
 
Backstab
 
If you can backstab an opponent to start a fight, you should certainly try
it.  In order to be backstabbed, however, an opponent must be at full hit
points.  If they never eat or drink (a good tactic against backstabbing),
they will always be a few hp below maximum.  You can always start a fight
by healing your opponent in the hopes of bringing them to full hit points,
then backstab them.  Naughty but Nice!
 
~
E
6~
Config +FLEE
 
Many players like this until they flee into a death trap.  In general, it's
a bad idea.  You are usually better off to recall than to flee.  If you have
problems recalling, as a last resort, you can try teleport.
 
 
Miscellaneous Tidbits
 
The susceptibility spells, (Razorbait, Swordbait, Winter Mist, Blazebane,
Ethereal Funnel) and the resistance spells, (Dragonskin, Demonskin, Inner
Warmth, Blazeward, Ethereal Shield) are of lesser value and you should
probably not trouble yourself with them until you have mastered all other
aspects of combat and strategy.  Suscpetibility spells may be useful when
fighting a known mob that takes a long time to defeat, as they tend to
reduce the time somewhat.  Spells like Eldritch Sphere, Antimagic Shell,
Shadowform and Valiance are also best left for specialized uses.
 
There are also some miscellaneous skills which are best left for specialized
use - (kick, punch, bash, circle).  Circle appears to be a wonderful skill,
but there are problems with it.  It only works in certain circumstances and
it locks you out (lags the circler) for a round or two.

You are walking down Law Avenue, the road which lines the southern wall
of Darkhaven.  The cobblestones here seem worn and used.  To the north
is the reason for this:  a mount and pet store.  Even from here you can
smell the faint scent of hay.  To the east is one of the four corners
of Darkhaven, while Law Avenue continues westward.

against an unseen attacker, although from the man's posture it is obvious
that his opponent was enormous.  A small golden plaque sits near the

Chamber of the Loot~
This silent room is where the thieves leave items of little or no value
to them, usually acquired during their 'spare time'.  Other thieves often
find the items left here useful and in this way the thieves of the guild
help each other.  To the east is a small, silent room, while the main
hall is to the south.

guild was allowed to keep the shrine due to a necessity to maintain

radiate a darkness, and runes of permanence, preservation and death
have been engraved in it.  The clerics of evil often come here to

wisely chose this location upon which to establish their hall.  The guild's
hall itself is much less of an actual building, and much more of a reshaping
of natural elements.  Situated around an open clearing in the forest, owing
to the preference most rangers share for being in the open, only a scant few
buildings can be seen, each scattered one from the other.  Paths lead off to

You walk carefully down the corridor, noticing its smooth stone floor and
walls. The walls and floor have been smoothed by age, and stains of blood
seem to randomly mark the stone surfaces.  You see a large foyer ahead of
you, and this corridor seems quite abandoned.  A strong wooden doorframe
is etched into the wall to the west, and through the doorway you can see a

tables.  An unnatural silence also seems to haunt this portion of

The Guild of Augurers~
Emerging from the forest around the cathedral, you find yourself in the
main hall of the Guild of Augurers.  Precious tapestries and drawings
adorn the walls gracefully, showing the beauty and strength of the Augurer.
The walls are granitelike and smooth, and the floors are painstakingly
polished to perfection.  The sweet smells of jasmine, parsley and other
assorted herbs fill the air around you, giving you a sense of warmth and
peace as you walk through the vast hall.

The walls all around you are made of stained glass, rather than the granite
in the hall, allowing the sunlight from the realms into this room.  A light
humming and singing can be heard in this spacious room, and the sweet smell
of jasmine is predominant here.  The Augurer is a very spiritual person,
and relies on meditation and reflection upon the day's activities in order
to be a productive citizen in the community.  Sculptures and handicrafts of
the Augurer lie in this room in a state of order, yet in a state of chaos
as well, showing the strengths and weaknesses of the Augurer's mind.

the large oak table, and at times you can find other Augurers here pondering
the existence of life, the importance of their daily deeds and anything else
that they wish to discuss.  The air in this room is still, and sounds from
the outside are not readily heard from this tiny room which seems to be shut
off from the rest of the Guild of Augurers.

As you enter this room, a strong feeling of charity washes over your very
life and soul.  The Chamber of Bounty is a darkened room, illuminated only
by torches fixed to the walls held by antiqued sconce holders.  All around 
you lie items donated by your fellow guild members, and those items that
may seem useless to one may be invaluable to others.  Precious armours,
treasures and pieces of magic lie here, and more are certainly welcome to
be donated for use by other Augurers.

The Tomb of Rectification~
As you enter this cramped room, the smell of burning oil and the stench of
day old sweat nearly bowls you over with a strong force. A large metal table
stands in the middle of the room, covered in many smithing tools. The constant
clank of metal on metal pierces your ears, and you look over to the western
wall of the room to see a large man stooping over the great table, repairing
a poor soul's gear.  Scraps of leather, cloth and fine fabrics lie in disarray
about this tiny room.

Soft light flows in from the east and coloured rays of sunshine seem to

tables lie nearby for placement of your drink and for game playing.  A
soft murmur of the other Augurers and the clinking of glasses fills
your ears with serenity.  This is where the Augurer comes to be refreshed
after a long day of fighting, training and ascertaining the local lore.

meditating and learning the lore of their class.  The room is brightly lit
by sconces upon the granitelike walls, and the air is nearly tasteless.
As the Augurer is very keen on its knowledge, a loremaster is here to help
you prepare and iterate your skills and spells.
