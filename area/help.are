56 ''IMM AUTH' 'IMM AUTHORIZE'~
Associated help files: authorize
 
Authorize <player> name -- This is the command used to allow a player to
  continue in the Spectral Gate pre-auth area, but will make them choose
  a new name prior to entering the Academy.  Use this command if the name
  is questionable, modern, or rude.  If the name is acceptible, but in all
  caps, accept the name, but send them a tell requesting they not use all
  caps for their name in the future.
 
Authorize <player> yes -- This is used to accept a players name.  Once this
  command is used, the player requires no further Immortal commands to enter
  the Realms.
 
Authorize <player> no -- This command is exclusively used to deny players
  with extremely rude or profane names and banned sites.  Use this command
  sparingly.
 
Levels 51-54 have primary responsibility for character authorization.  All
Immortals should periodically type 'authorize' to assure their are not any
players waiting for authorization.  The new system allows the Immortals a
bit of time to decide if an name is appropriate before accepting or denying
it.  If you are in doubts to a names acceptibilty, but it is not profane or
extremely modern, you should probably accept it.

62 AASIGN~
~

53 AASSIGN~
Syntax: aassign <filename>.are  Example:  aassign edo.are
 
AASSIGN temporarily assigns all rooms, objects, and mobiles in the area
range to your pfile.  This allows you to use rlist, olist, mlist, and
reset list.  This also means that typing savearea, reset area, or 
instazone will affect this area.  
 
To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.
 
&rWarning&w!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.
 
In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you by a Greater God or higher.
 
In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by an Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed
only Lesser+ can aassign themselves nonproto areas.
~

1 'ABATTOIR ASYLUM'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50

Once a monument to health and sanity, the Abbot Hill Asylum has been
corrupted over the years and now lies in a state of irrepairable decay.
Located on a large isle in the Blood Sea, the insane and dying were once
brought there to be healed and cared for. Unfortunately, it seems that the
priests in care of these decrepit souls were infected by the same lack of
sanity they were attempting to cure. What was once a place of peace and
salvation has become a haven of the damned, ruled by chaos unbridled.
~

1 'ACETUM PRIMUS'~
'Acetum Primus,' is the third and most powerful of the known acid
disciplines at the Mage's disposal.  This incantation pulls forth the
strongest caustic agents in the casting Mage's neighboring planes,
and propels them in a tight cyclone-like blast towards the Mage's
chosen victim.  The cross-dimensional disturbance, the physical
violence, and the bonescouring potency of the conjured compound all
work together to effect an estimable estrapade.
~

1 'ACID BLAST' 'BURNING HANDS' 'COLOUR SPRAY' FIREBALL 'LIGHTNING BOLT'

  'MAGIC MISSILE' 'SHOCKING GRASP'~
These are all attack spells and should not be used against another player
unless both you and the other player are listed under 'who deadly' and are
within the legal pkill level range.

1) Syntax:  cast fireball         <victim>
2) Syntax:  cast 'acid blast'     <victim>
4) Syntax:  cast 'colour spray'   <victim>
5) Syntax:  cast 'shocking grasp' <victim>
6) Syntax:  cast 'burning hands'  <victim>
7) Syntax:  cast 'magic missile'  <victim>
 
Each of these spells inflict variable damage on the victim.  The higher the
caster's level, the more damage inflicted.  The spells are listed by their
inherent power from strongest to weakest, though differences in strength
are in many cases minimal.
~

0 'ACID BREATH' 'FIRE BREATH' 'FROST BREATH' 'GAS BREATH' 'LIGHTNING BREATH'~
Syntax: cast 'acid breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'fire breath'      <victim>
Syntax: cast 'frost breath'     <victim>
Syntax: cast 'gas breath'
Syntax: cast 'lightning breath' <victim>

These spells are for the use of dragons.  Acid, fire, frost, and lightning
damage one victim, whereas gas damages every PC in the room.  Fire and
frost can break objects, and acid can damage armor.

High level mages may learn and cast these spells as well.
 
Be aware that area attacks are aggressive to all mobs in the room,
including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.
Gas breath is an area attack, the other breath spells are not.

-1 AD ADS ADVERTISING~
.
It is against the rules of this mud to advertise another mud either on
public channels (say, chat, ask, answer, shout, yell, music, quest, avatar,
newbiechat, any guild, order, clan or council channel, wartalk or racetalk),
through your title, description, or biography or via leaving a note on any
public, guild, order, clan or council board in the Realms.  If you are
asked to desist and do not do so immediately, your priveleges on this mud
may be restricted or terminated.
 
~

60 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

52 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction, as well as
the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one, use
a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
  redit exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to refer to
it by number:
  redit exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
  (to know what number an exit is, do an "rstat")
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one of
the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It's also usually a good idea
to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer to those
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
  redit exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
  redit exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
  redit exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
  ... here, if a player types 'swim' in the room they will move to room 3001

-1 ADVENTURE~
.
   In our efforts to give credit to everyone who deserves it, we almost
   forgot to give credit to one of the "grandfathers" of computer adventure
   games... David Platt, the author of the original "Adventure" (c)1979.

   Also credit to Ken Wellsch for porting the original Fortran-77 version
   to UNIX-C (over a period of about 3 years) (c)1984.

1 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
Syntax:  affected       (abbrevation:  af)
Syntax:  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)
 
'Affected' is a spells-at-a-glance function, which displays only the spells
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <spell/skill name> or 'score').
 
Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its spell/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.
 
'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.
~

51 AFFECTEDBY AFFECTED_BY~
The following are affect flags that can be used when osetting an item
(with oset <item> affect affected <affect flag>).  These flags can also
be used when msetting a mobile (mset <mob name> affected <affect flag>).
They may additionally be used to mset players if your level allows it.
 
Blind          Invisible    Detect_evil  Detect_invis  Detect_magic
Detect_hidden  **Hold**     Sanctuary    Faerie_fire   Infrared
Curse          **Flaming**  Poison       Protect       Paralysis
Sneak          Hide         Sleep        Charm         Flying

0 AFK~
Syntax:  afk (abbreviation for "away from keyboard")
 
The 'afk' command will place an [AFK] flag beside your name on the who 
list when activated, as well as informing those who send tells that you
you are afk.  It can be toggled on or off by typing afk, and will also
go off automatically when you enter any command.
 
~

1 AGGRESSIVE~
Syntax: style aggressive
 
This style of combat allows a fighter to strike more effectively, but
leaves many holes in his defenses as well. Fighters who know this tactic
can strike enemies for more damage, but their enemies' weapons will slip
through their defenses for slightly more damage as well.
 
See Also: style, evasive, defensive, standard, aggressive, berserk
~

0 AID~
Syntax: aid <character>

This skill allows you to bring a stunned person back into consciousness.
~

1 ALERTNESS~
Syntax:  c alertness <self>
 
Alertness renders the target resistant to the sleep spell.
~

52 ALIGNMENT ALIGN ZAPPING~
Your alignment can range from +1000 to -1000. When you are +1000 this
means that you are good aligned, when you are -1000 this means you are
evil aligned, and when you are 0 aligned this means you are neutral.
You can change your alignment by killing good or evil aligned mobs.
This will raise or lower your alignment.

The different alignments will allow you to wear different pieces of
equipment. If you are good aligned and try to wear a piece of equipment
which is antigood, you will be zapped, which means the piece of eq will
fall to the ground. The same occurs when you are evil and you try to
wear an antievil piece of eq, or if you are neutral and try to wear
an antineutral piece of eq. You can also be zapped during battle if you
are fighting a mob opposite of your align.

You can find out what your alignment is by typing SCORE.
~

58 ALLOW BAN~
ALLOW BAN WARN
Syntax:  allow  site/race/class    <address/race/class>
Syntax:  ban    site/race/class    <address/race/class>   <type>    <duration>
Syntax:  ban    show               <class/site/race>      <number>
Syntax:  warn   <site/class/race>  <number>
 
BAN site will ban a site from playing the game.
BAN race bans anyone with that race from playing the game.

warn. If you set it to a level everyone equal to that level and below will not
be allowed on.  Warn, sends a warning to the Warn: channel that someone if
logging in from the site, with a certaing class or race.  If you add the
duration, the ban will expire in that many days. Sites can be banned with the *
wildcard as well.  Be carefull however as *.edu would ban everysite from .edu,
or *foo* would ban anysite that had the string foo in it.
BAN show, will print out the reason why that particular site/race or class was
banned and by who.  Number can be a class or race name, a site address or
you can use # followed by the ban number.
WARN will toggle the warn flag on a CURRENTLY banned site/class or race.

Comment:  the auc code needs to be modified to allow the auccing
  of poisoned weapons (current message says it's decaying)
Answer:   poisoned weapons are decaying
 
Comment:  ok ok peeps.. one more time:  me avatar.  me starving
  but cannot see it.  me recharge verrrrrrrry slowwwwwly
  [this person subsequently threatened to leave the mud and take
  people with him because we wouldn't fix such "bugs"]
Answer:   you could try typing 'score' to see your hunger and
  thirst.  Avatars used to see their thirst and hunger messages,
  but then nobody liked that and everyone wanted them removed.
  The idea of a config +/- hunger_and_thirst_messages seems
  ridiculous to me.  Not many people have a problem keeping
  track by using score, they just pay attention.
 
Comment:  this area bites, we need areas with mobs in them not
  pretty descs
Answer:  what "we need" varies.  I'd be an idiot to refuse any
  area that fit any of our needs, be they killing fields or
  social zones or transition areas or what-have-you.  Work on
  one has nothing to do with work on another.
 
Comment:  after 4 years youd think you could stop us crashing
  so <expletive> much
Answer:  after 4 years you'd think someone would know there are
  a number of things affecting any mud's stability, some of them
  being beyond our control.  It's not like we enjoy it when the
  system crashes, and don't take steps as quickly as we can to
  correct the problem.
 
Comment:  i find the description of the tourist as a small round
  japanese man offensive
Answer:  I am ashamed I have offended you.
 
Comment:  I'm getting worried that you guys don't get my ideas and that
  I do this for naught
Answer:  they're read, sometimes once a week, usually always once a
  month, and in extremely rare cases (like this one) once every two.
 
Question:  why are manyaggro mobs either good or neutral?
Answer:  the evil ones are more tucked away, but I agree that it's
  odd to have a good-aligned aggro mob unless it's defending its
  territory or something like that.
 
Comment:  who <playername> should let you see the player.

1 ANTARCTICA~
Recommended level range: 10 - 30

The frozen wastes of Antarctica lie far to the south of Darkhaven,
separated from the main continent by a vast ocean. Hidden in this
land of ice is the town of Little Haven. Two great heroines of Light rule
over the gnomes of this town: the Shieldmaiden Brunhilde and the Snow
Queen. The gnomes have created deadly frost giants to aid in the 
protection of the town and have also enlisted the aid of a fearsome blue
dragon. It is a comforting thought that very little threat arises from
Antarctica, for the Realms are already dark enough...
~

0 'ANTIMAGIC SHELL' ANTIMAGIC SHELL~
This spell makes you more resistant to all types (including beneficial
types) of magic.
~

0 APPRAISE~
Syntax: appraise <item>
        appraise all

1 'AQUA BREATH' 'AQUA'~
Syntax: cast 'aqua breath' <character>
 
This spell allows you to breath in water areas and underwater.  Certain
water sectors will require the use of aqua breath to prevent damage from
drowning.  If you are in an area and your movement suddenly begins to
drop and/or you begin losing hps <hitpoints>, you should either cast
aqua breath immediately or leave the area.
 
~

1 ARACHNOS~
Recommended level range: 5 - 20

A large amount of Haon Dor's treetops is covered in a sticky film:
the webs of a thousand spiders. The realm of Arachnos, as it is called
by Darkhaven's adventurers, is a series of twisting, intricate webs
populated by arachnids and spiders. Some say that this fear-filled place
is named Arachnos after the name of its hideous ruler. The stories tell
of a dragon housed deep within the area, answering to the name of Yevaud.

1 ARCANES~
.
                * * * As One, We Are Strong * * *

That is our motto, and for it we fight.   The Ancient Order of Arcanes is
an elite group of practitioners of the Magicks with a long and honorable
history dating far back into the days of the old clans, when the Arcanes,
one of the earliest of the peaceful clans, stood apart from the fray and
strove to hold the beacon of light and knowledge proudly aloft in a
darkening world.  We have lived on in the heart of the Realms through
many centuries of peace and war.
 
Arcanes try to master the knowledge of the ever-changing world about them.
With knowledge comes power, and with power responsibility.  Our magicks
are strong, and rarely do we taste defeat.  But we use our strength and
power to help one another; and where we can do no good in the world abroad,
we at least strive to do no harm.  Members live by, and live up to, a
demanding Code of Conduct which requires teamwork and cooperation among
members, and honor and fair dealing in the outside world.  The Arcanes
reside in a castle created out of the fabric of magic itself, which stands
as a testimony to Arcanes' power and strength.
 
Order members' solidarity and coordination are unrivalled.  Almost every
day, and frequently more than once in a day, the Order conducts some
activity to which all members are invited -- whether simple exploring/
mobkilling, practicing pk, questing among ourselves, or participating as
a team in mudwide quests -- for mutual benefit and enjoyment.  To the
extent possible, these events are held at different times of the day, to
permit the widest possible participation.

Those who distinguish themselves in such activities are regularly rewarded
from the Order Treasury.  The Order also continually seeks to reward those
who seek out knowledge and put it to the use of the Order.
 
For information on applying to Arcanes, type 'Help Arcanes Inductions'
~

2 'ARCANES INDUCTIONS'~
&YTo be considered for admission, the applicant character:&W
-- must be of a manausing class, level 25+;  not currently a member of any
  guild or Order,  and at least 100 years old
-- must submit a "resume," mudsigned (posted and taken) including:
  (i) player's total time on the mud, (ii) prior guild/Order affiliations
  (iii) reasons for interest and how they think they can contribute,
  (iv) any outcast from or rejection by the Order of any character controlled
  by the same player, and (v) contacts' names and how they know them
-- must submit notes from 3 or more contacts, which must be (i) mortals and
  (ii) neither current Arcanes, Arcanes-Recruits or -Initiates, nor alts 
  thereof.  The contacts' notes must be mudsigned, and state how, and how long
  the contact knows the applicant, and ideally include information on the 
  contacts' alts and typical hours on to facilitate further contacts.  A
  A backup contact or two beyond the three minimum is also helpful.
 
Applicants with notes ready should contact a Scout, who will verify
that the applicant qualifies and decide whether or not to process the
application.   The Scout may decline or defer acceptance of an application,
in which case the applicant may contact another scout.  If any character 
owned by the same player was rejected or outcast for disciplinary reasons (not
inactivity), the applicant must first seek permission to apply from the
LeadScout or a Leader.  Such requests are ordinarily not considered
until at least 3 months have passed.

Alts of current Arcanes are simply inducted by any leader if they are of
the appropriate class and level (the age minimum does not apply).
Special procedures may apply to imm alts. Interested Immortals should
contact a leader or the Deity before submitting an application.
 
&CFor further information about the inductions process and the Order
generally, as well as a list of members, please stop by the Order
webpage, which is linked to the RoD webpage.

1 AREAS~
Syntax:  areas
Syntax:  areas old
Syntax:  areas <low range> <hi range>
 
The 'areas' command displays an alphabetically sorted list of all areas
within the game, together with the author and suggested level range of
each area.  
 
The 'areas old' command displays an unsorted list of all areas (the old
style), as well as the author and suggested level range of each area.
 
You can specify a level range to see a list of all areas with suggested
ranges which encompass the argument.  This can be a little awkward as
each area has a low and a high suggested range.  Suffice to say that if
an area's level range matches even one level of the range you request,
it will be displayed.
 
Special thanks to Fireblade for design and coding of this restyled function.
The Realms of Despair will provide a copy of areas built by individuals
to that individual and no one else. To receive a copy of an area for use
on other muds, you must contact that individual.
 
~

0 ARMOR~
Syntax: cast armor <character>

This spell decreases (improves) the armor class of the target character
by 20 points.
~

52 ARMORCLASS~
.
&gThere are two values used with armor class for object type Armor:
 
&GValue0: Variable amount based on level of item at repop.
Value1: Maximum repairable armor setting for the object.
 
&gSetting Value0 has no effect. It will re-adjust itself on repop based on
the repop level of the item. Setting Value1 below the expected repop value
for Value0 will result in an item that cannot be repaired until Value0 drops
below Value1's setting. The listing below gives you a rough approximation of 
the values returned for Value0 based on level:
 
&GLevel Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0   Level Invoked   Value0 
-------------   ------   -------------   ------   -------------   ------   
      1           1-3         10           3-5         20           6-8
     30           8-10        40          11-13        50          13-15
     
&gThe amount that Value0 is set to determines the amount the player's A.C. will
be adjusted. Different wear locations have a different multiplying affect:
 
&G0 X Value0: Wield, Ears.
1 X Value0: Arms,  Finger, Neck, Feet, Hands, Shield, Waist, Wrist, Hold, Eyes.
2 X Value0: Head,  Legs,   About.
3 X Value0: Body.
 
&gSee also OSET, AFFECTTYPES, WEARFLAGS, OBJECTFLAGS, OBJECTTYPES, ITEMVALUES,
WEAPONTYPES, VARIABLES, and OMENU.

1 'ASTRAL WALK' 'FARSIGHT' 'PORTAL' 'HELICAL FLOW'~
Syntax:  cast 'astral walk'  <victim>  Syntax:  cast 'farsight'     <victim>
Syntax:  cast 'portal'       <victim>  Syntax:  cast 'helical flow' <victim>
 
These spells allow the very shape of space and time to be warped at the
caster's bidding:
 
'Astral walk' instantaneously moves the caster to the victim's location.
 
'Farsight' allows you to see the room in which the victim stands.
 
'Portal' forms a temporary tunnel through space to the victim.  A portal
will not succeed if a portal already exists in either the caster's or
the victim's location.  Type 'enter' or 'enter portal' to pass through.
 
'Helical Flow' morphs an Augurer into a coil of colour which instantly
travels to the victim's location.
 
These spells may fail if either the victim or the caster is in a location
which blocks their use, such as no-recall areas, no-summon areas, etc.

2 ATTACKER ATTACKERFLAG ATTACKERFLAGS~
&PAttacker &Wflags are automatically given by the mud code to players
who engage in illegal attacks upon other players. These attacks can
initiated by using MURDER, casting an attack spell, or ordering
followers to attack a player. Deadlies attacking Deadlies do not
receive Attacker Flags. These flags are only given out in situations
that involve Peaceful players, i.e. Deadlies attacking Peacefuls,
(or vice versa), or Peacefuls attacking Peacefuls. You will be
tagged with an &PAttacker &Wflag if:
 
  1. You attempt to MURDER another player, or they attempt to
  MURDER you. (See &CHelp Murder &Wand &GLaws Pkill &Wfor more info
  on attacking other players).
 
  2. You order charmed mobiles or pets to attack a player, or you
  are attacked by another players mobiles. (See &CHelp Charm &Wor
  &CHelp Pets &Wfor more info)>
 
  3. You are a &RDeadly &Wplayer and attacked a fellow Clanmember.

&WDarkhaven Guards, shopkeepers and special function mobs now respond
differently to illegal flags. You may find yourself barred from making
purchases, placed before Judge Kendra for a hearing, or sentenced to
jail. Should you acquire an &PAttacker &Wor any other illegal activity
flag, see Judge Kendra in Townhall. Her Honour is located one west of
the Main Lobby (See &CHelp Townhall &Wfor info).

1 AUC AUCTION~
.Syntax: auction (abbreviations: a , auc)
Syntax: auction <item name> <starting value>
Syntax: auction bid <value>
 
The auction command is used for performing auctions.  Simply typing auction
will display the current item being auctioned, if there is one.  
 
If nothing is being auctioned, auction <item name> <starting value> will 
begin an auction.  If no starting value is specified, it begins at 0 gold.
 
Auction bid <value> will place a bet for the item.
 
Special thanks to Erwin Andreasen for writing this function.
(Ported to SMAUG from a publicly available source.)
 
At the present, if the mud crashes in mid auction, you will lose both 
your bidded money and the item.  This will at some point be fixed.
 
You are able to see auction almost from the point of character creation,
however, you cannot USE auction unless you're level FIVE or higher. To remove
the auction channel from your screen, type CHANNEL -AUCTION.
SEE also "help AUCTION2" for more on auction commands
&Y* Auctions will not be stopped for overbidding or misbidding*&w
~

1 AUCTION2~
Auction will also work with the following arguments:
 
au bid 20k      - bids 20000 coins
au bid 20k500   - bids 20500 coins (20,000 + 500)
au bid 20k5003  - bids 20500 coins, too (only checks first 3 chars after "k")
au bid 1m       - bids 1 million coins
 
On an existing bid of 10000:
au bid +10       - adds 10%, making the bet 11000.
au bid +         - adds 25% (the default if no number given), bet is 12500.
au bid x         - multiplies by 2, making the bet 20000.
au bid x5        - multiplies by 5, making the bet 50000.
 
It is illegal to auction <or barter, sell, trade> clan, order, or guild items.
Exception: Old clan equipment that was converted to be worn by both peaceful
           and deadly players.
 
Also see: 'HELP AUCTION' for more information.

51 AUCTIONSTOP~
Syntax <auctionstop>

&WAuctionstop is to be used to halt the auctioning of illegal items, ie:
deadly equipment, order/clan/guild items. Auctions are NOT to be
stopped for overbidding, misbidding, or misauctioning.

recall scrolls if sold alone. If they are inside a container with other
items, they may be auctioned.

0 AUGURER AUGURERS~
The Augurer is very strong-minded in its nature, both physically and
magically. It is very confident of its actions in combat, and this
confidence shows in its physical appearance.  The Augurer is of a
medium height, with a defined bone structure which shows both
intelligence and assurance.  Its appearance is wizened, but at times
the Augurer may look frail due to exhaustion.  Though it is of a
medium size, its physical strength is not.  The Augurer relies on
both brain and brawn to overcome its challengers.  When it is
confronted, its wisdom decides what course of action it should take,
and wisdom is its prime stat.
 
While in combat, the Augurer is capable of utilizing both spells and
skills to their greatest potential.  However, because of the Augurer's
size, it tires of magic easily.  To overcome this mental exhaustion,
the Augurer is a strong believer in the use of mana for rejuvination
of its magical powers, and uses a lot of it.  In its spare time, the
Augurer enjoys the local lore, both the teaching and learning of it,
as well as musical and theatrical pursuits.  The Augurer is a very
independent person, and spends much of its spare time in meditation,
reflecting upon the days activities.

fireball may injure themselves when the spell backfires.

1 BACKSTAB BS~
Syntax:  backstab <victim>
Syntax:  bs       <victim>
 
A backstab is a method of attack, used primarily by thieves but able
to be utilized by others in some circumstances, and which inflicts a
tremendous degree of damage on unsuspecting victims if successful.
 
An appropriate weapon type is required to backstab, and if your victim
is wounded or suspicious it may not be possible to surprise them.  The
most important factor in anyone's ability to backstab is to catch the
victim when they are unaware of your presence.

51 BAMFIN BAMFOUT~
Syntax: bamfin  <message>

'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the BAMFIN and BAMFOUT commands.
~

51 'BAN 50'~
Seeking to ban a site above level 1 should be an extremely rare situation. One
in which the actions of one or more key persons from a site are deemed to be
a detriment to the enjoyment of a large portion of the players in the game.
Such person(s) are generally deemed to be beyond rehabilitation at this time.
 
When seeking to ban a site, make use of the Grub command to both see the impact
of the ban, and to get a list of all character names from the site. You can use
this list to keep an eye out for these characters coming in from other sites,
as it's obvious these days that a site ban may not always cure the situation.
 
All site bans above level one should be set at level 50 or higher. It should be
a rare instance in which a site is banned at some in between level. Only in the
direst of instances would a site be banned above level 50, as this will affect
immortal level players as well.
 
See also: 'BAN ALLOW' 'BAN NEWBIE' 'BAN DURATION' 
~

51 'BAN DURATION'~
The standard set for ban durations are as follows:
 
Newbie Ban:          1) One week on first instance.
                     2) Two weeks for the second.
                     3) One month at newbie, or level 50 for third.
                     4) Permanent at newbie, or level 50 for 4th offense.
 
Bans for level 2-50: 1) One month for first instance.
                     2) Two months, or permanent for 2nd.
                     3) Permanent for 3rd offense.
 
All bans above level 50 should be permanent by their very nature.
 
&WReminder - Without documenting each time we ban a site, we will have no
           source of history on sites. Always remember to post a note
           detailing the reasons for the ban.&w

51 'BAN NEWBIE'~
Banning a site is a form of last resort, as it not only affects the offending
player or players, but will also affect every other player from that site.
Before seeking to ban a site, even for a temporary level 1 banning, make
sure you have exhausted all other options first. 
 
In the case of newbie bans, most such instances arise through the actions of 
one or more abusive players who log in a newbie and begin swearing, spamming, 
threatening, etc.. Many times this has developed from an immature player's 
frustrations over getting a name authed. If you find a player going through a 
series of silly names trying to auth them, make every effort to try and talk 
with them first. If this fails, use Fquit to discourage them. If you have 
Disconnect, use this instead, as it is less provoking than fquit (makes it 
appear as if they simply lost their conneection). If they continue their 
efforts, send them warnings to get their attention. Use freeze if you have it 
(or if someone else is on who can use it) to get their attention and make sure 
received the message. Then, and only then, once you've exhausted all avenues
at being civil, you can use ban in good conscience. You've given the player(s)
every chance to cease their actions and given them fair warning over the fact
that if they continue they risk getting banned.

58 BARENUM BARESIZE~
Syntax: mset <mob> barenum <number>
mset <mob> baresize <num>

These mob fields control the mobs ability to fight without weapons.

the outside world.

0 BASH~
Syntax:  bash
 
Bash can only be used once a fight has started.  It will inflict damage and
temporarily daze both yourself and your opponent for approximately two rounds

consequences are inflicted on your opponent if it is a player character,
otherwise the skill only inflicts damage.

This tactic is truly powerful, for it causes the fighter to allow pure
rage to flow through him, at the cost of his own judgement and care for
his or her well-being. While the berserked fighter will strike deeper

their weapons deeper into the berserker.

more minor duties.  Use the 'order' command to give them orders.
 
Be warned, you are responsible for the actions of your charmed beast.  If
it should go awry and take the life of another player-character, you will
be charged as a murderer and will be hunted by several creatures around
the Realms.
 
Aggressive mobs will lose their aggressiveness while charmed, but will
immediately return to their violent ways when the spell wears off.  For
this reason, charmed aggressive mobs should not be taken into any area
lower from the one from which they came, and should *never* be taken
into Darkhaven or the Academy.  Those found doing so will pay dearly.
 
As a matter of etiquette, charmed mobs should not be attacked.  You can
tell a mob is charmed if it is wandering "in a dazed, zombie-like state."
Be aware when taking your charmed mobs around other characters that any
area attack such as call lightning, gas breath or earthquake will hit
your creature and cause it to engage in combat.

51 COLORS~
The ability to color Help and other files is very useful. We ask
that you try to stick to these guidelines for color usage so that
we can have some consistency in their use:
 
Here are some outlines for using color on a white text file:
  &CHelp (Filename) &Wcolored cyan.
  &GLaws (Law) &WColored green.
  &PAttacker/Killer/Thief &Wcolored pink.
  &GOrder/Guild (Order/Guild) &Wcolored green.
  &RClans (Clan) &Wcolored red.
  &YSyntax  &Wfor sytax references, colored yellow.
  &CDeities (Deity) &Wcolored cyan.
  &RDeadly/Dealies &Wcolored red.
  &YConfig (+/- option) &Wcolored yellow.
 
If you wish to add other colors to your file, please use good
taste, make sure it is readable and don't get too whacky. If
you follow the above guidelines and stick to using white for
all other text, it will keep the text solid and legible. Should
you choose not to use any colors at all, that is also okay, the
above guidlines are merely for proper use of color, white is
always acceptable.
 
In addition, please keep in mind that the following topics should
not be colored except by their defaults:
  - Help (area name)
  - Help (skill)
  - Help (spell)
  - Help (class)
~

1 COMBAT~
You may choose a fight by finding a mob, and using LOOK, CONSIDER, and
IDENTIFY to gauge the difficulty of the opponent.  You can LOOK <mob>
to get a look at its equipment and description, this will often help
indicate how hard a fight might be. You can CONSIDER <mob> for a one
on one comparison of the mobs hitpoints and level to your own.  You may
also CAST IDENTIFY <mob> to get more detailed information about the mob.
 
You may start a fight by using KILL, MURDER, or many spells and skills
available to players.  The easiest way to start a fight is to KILL <mob>.
Currently, you may also MURDER <mob>, but this causes the mob to yell out.
 
You may find yourself in trouble during a fight, and wish to leave, this
can be done by using FLEE or RECALL.  You can flee a fight by typing FLEE.
You may recall from a fight with the spell 'word of recall' or by reciting
a recall scroll.  You may also set it up to flee automatically once you go
below a certain number of hitpoints by using WIMPY.  To use your wimpy, type
WIMPY or WIMPY <number of hitpoints>.  Leaving a fight with wimpy, flee, and
recall WILL cost you a loss of experience, with recall causing the greatest
loss.
 
For more information on combat, read section 12 of your Adventurer's Guide.

who makes frequent demands of or troubles for immortals in general even if
the player is not doing something specifically illegal, repeated problems,
after _all_ reimbursements, and any other information you feel would be
important to another Immortal when dealing with the player in the future.
 
If you have a disciplinary action and the player quits before you are able to
post a comment, please place a copy of the comment on the board located in
hell, room vnum 6.

1 'CORAL DEPTHS'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 35

Following the Darkhaven River eastward, many an adventurer has come upon
a vast area of glistening water and waves.  A casual swim is enjoyed here,
though one must be wary of fish and aggressive sharks.  It is beneath the
lapping waves where the wonders, and dangers, of the Coral Depths truly lurk.
The fabled Merfolk have founded a paradise under the sea, pushing back all
manners of danger from their wondrous village.  Some of the most wise and
intelligent scholars of Despair reside in Mer Village, teaching the cherished
young.  The Merfolk have one common enemy beneath the waves: a sea hag who
resides in the deepest corner of the dark coral tunnels.  Little is known
about this hag, yet it is suspected that she is preparing one day to destroy
the Merfolk completely...

1 'CR' 'CORPSE RETRIEVAL' 'CORPSE'~
Before asking an immortal for a corpse retrieval, you &r-must-:&w
 
&r    -&w Attempt to get your corpse yourself, &rand
    -&w Use invis and hidden, this will get you past a lot of mobiles,&r and
    -&w Seek mortal assistance to retrieve your corpse.&r
    -&g If all else fails, wait at least 20 minutes after death to ask for an
      Immortal corpse retrieval.&w

**  "I need to leave now!" is not grounds for an early Immortal CR.
**  Corpses last approximately 40 - 60 minutes after the time of death.
**  Corpse decay will happen even while you are linkdead or after you quit.
**  Characters listed under 'who deadly' are not eligible for Immortal CR.
**  Corpses _will_ save over crashes and reboots, but will continue to decay
    once the Realms comes back online.  Log back on quickly to get corpse.

The cost for CRs is usually one item from your corpse.  An Immortal may
choose to charge MORE or LESS. 
 
&gAn Immortal corpse retrieval is not a right, but a privilege.&w  Pestering
or being demanding is cause for the Immortal to deny your request.  An
Immortal may refuse to do any CR at their discretion.  You may not barter
which items an Immortal can take from your corpse as the charge, the
Immortal's decision is final.
~

1 CRASH~
Crashes are unforeseen interruptions in the game that cause everyone
to be disconnected. If you type time and look at the system start up
time, you can determine if the game has just rebooted or if it was a
problem with only your character. 
   99.9% of the time corpses will save over a crash. The game will 
start back up with your character at the last place you saved or the
game saved you.

Dear SoD,
I can't get into any orders because (order name withheld) blackened my
name for life after my brother signed on my character and stole stuff.
Orders suck. I think they should all be disbanded.
 -&CNeed Order in My Life&W
 
Dear You Want Fries With That Order,
The Sage spoke to each of the orders in the realms and they all offered
the same verdit on you. You suck. The Sage thinks you better get your
house in order before you go around trying to pass judgement on the
orders in our realms. If your brother is responsible for stealing eq
while impersonating you than you are responsible. How is it that your
brother was able to peel your face from that lump you pass off as your
body? Surely you didnt notice that your face had been removed? Of course
not. One so mentally chalenged as you would never miss something as
trivial as his face. If you are going to allow someone to use your face
and thus assume your identity than you will have to face (heh notice the
clever Sage pun) the consequences. If you cant keep your face to
yourself perhaps you would like the Sage to hold it for you? I have some
flesh borer beetles who were looking for a place to live. Get your face
stitched on, straighten up your act and maybe, just maybe, you will
still suck. Leave me now.
Scalpel please,
 &GThe Sage of Despair&W

The Russian dog snarled and leaped out of its cage and charged 
the American dachshund. But, when it got close enough to bite 
the Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund opened its mouth and 
consumed the Russian dog in one bite. There was nothing left 
at all of the Russian dog. 
 
The Russians came up to the Americans shaking their heads in 
disbelief. "We don't understand how this could have happened. 
We had our best people working for five years with the meanest 
Doberman and Rottweiller females in the world and the biggest, 
meanest Siberian wolves."
 
"That's nothing", an American replied. "We had our best plastic

0 DAMAGE~
When one character attacks another, the severity of the damage is shown
in the verb used in the damage message.  Damage messages vary depending
on weapon type, or what is inflicting the damage.  Escalating damage is
indicated by the use of _ _ around the messages, regardless of weapon
type.  Messages in all caps indicate even higher degrees of damage,
while those surrounded by * * indicate the highest levels.
 
The message shown will reflect the actual damage you are inflicting on
(or receiving from) your opponent, and not a specific fixed amount.
~

51 DAMPLUS~
.
For those unsure of what damplus is, it is part of the damage
equasion for a mob... ie:  10d6 + 10   (the +10 is the damplus)
This "damplus" is always added, whether or not the mob is barehanded or
wielding a weapon.   This is basically the mob's damroll.

1 DARKHAVEN~
Recommended level range: 0 - 60


Darkhaven, famed City of Hope, lies in the center of the Realm's main
continent. The city, though constantly under the threat of invasion, has
never fallen to the forces of Darkness and remains one of Light's most
fervent defenders. In fact, the greatest adventurers of Despair originate
from Darkhaven, probably due to the excellent teachings of the famed
Darkhaven Academy. Darkhaven is a growing city, with busy markets filled
with objects of wonder and anyone wishing to join one of Despair's nine
guilds will certainly want to visit Darkhaven, where the guild halls are
located. Also of note is the newly revamped Art Gallery and Town Hall.
~

1 'DARKHAVEN ACADEMY'~
Recommended level range: 1 - 5

The Darkhaven Academy is the training institute of majestic Darkhaven.
A great number of adventurers come here to learn the basics of battle and
spellcasting, as well as many survival techniques. Magically controlled
by Avatars of the most powerful deities, there is an abundance of monsters
here kept for the sole purpose of practice and tutelage.
~

1 'DARKHAVEN ART GALLERY'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 50

The strange, magical artwork of Darkhaven's artisans is represented
here. Beautiful paintings and strange sculptures abound in this
strange building, which was wrought of stone by the dwarves. It is
rumored that there is more to the artwork than meets the eye. Some
even say that you may enter the paintings as if they were portals to
distant places...

1 DEADLYCLANS~
Clans are a society within Realms composed of a group of players which
have joined together under a common cause.  If you a member of a 
clan you have the ability to pkill other deadly players outside of your
own clan.  Depending on the clan in which you join, you may be asked 
to follow set of rules dictated by the clan's leaders. 

For more information on a current deadly clan type HELP <clanname>
 
NOTE: Non-deadly and deadly players may join a deadly clan, however
when the character is outcasted it remains deadly.
~

1 DEADLYHQ~
Peacefuls are not permitted EVER to enter deadly headquarters.
~

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated at the Altar to Thoric in
Darkhaven (or your clan's temple).  Your corpse is left behind where you
were killed, together with all of your equipment.  Your gold stays with
you (the gods want you to have your gold).
 
Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death, and you lose
experience points as well.  Following/groups are not affected by death.
 
Corpses decay after time.  When this happens the objects inside a corpse
will decay with it.  Player corpses last roughly 30 minutes of real time.
Only the player who died or someone in their group can retrieve objects
from a player's corpse.  The only exceptions are for deadly characters,
who can loot each other's corpses at will.
 
If you have chosen a deity and have gained enough favor, you may be able
to supplicate to your god for your corpse.  Also see 'help supplicate',
'help deities', 'help favor' for more information on deities.
 
For more information on death, see section 13 of your Adventurers Guide.
 
~

1 DEATHTRAP DT~
A "death trap" refers to the scenario where one steps into a room and is
immediately awakened from death with no equipment or corpse. A corpse
recovery is not an option in this case as there is no corpse to retrieve.
 
There are also pseudo death traps that may appear to be a dt, but leave a 
corpse or transfer a corpse to another area. This is not a true dt. 
 
It is often advisable to look before one leaps and heed room descriptions.
DT's do not warrant a reimbursement, they are a part of the game. Gold, 
glory and favor are not affected by a death trap.

1 DEFENSIVE~
Syntax: style defensive
 
This style emphasizes the deflecting of blows from an enemy. It is similar
to the evasive style, except that it focuses on holding ground instead of
dodging. An effective fighter will take less damage from an enemy, but not
as much as one using evasive tactics. A fighter will also do less damage to
enemies, but slightly greater than those who simply evade.

hospitality.  A wall painting illustrates the history of The Symposium in
great detail.  It is here that anyone needing to speak with the Leader of
the Symposium is welcome to relax.  The council's secretary is often seen
here, buried beneath piles of parchments in an unending effort to perform
all of her duties for this very busy group.  The chamberlain, who works
here on a volunteer basis, is often distracted.  Enjoy your visit, and

An Immortal can request you change your description or bio if it contains
inappropriate material.  Do not use profanity, racial slurs, sexual comments,

to change your bio, description, or title on Immortal request is grounds for
loss of character privileges.

~

1 DEX DEXTERITY~
Dexterity (DEX in your 'score') represents your character's agility, and
it affects (among other things):
 
 - the maximum number of items you can carry at once in your inventory;
   with each additional point of dex you can carry additional items.
 
 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural
   armor class.
 
 - the number of new moves you receive each time you level, as well as the
   number of moves you regenerate at each tick (when resting to refresh or
   regain movement points).
 
 - success chances with bash, stun and gouge, and helps determine whether a
   thief will be able to poison a weapon or tumble effectively.
 
Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many
of the valuable vials.
 
Dexterity is the prime attribute of thieves and vampires.
 
~

61 DIAGNOSE~
Syntax:  diagnose of 20
 
Diagnose of n - object frequency of top "n" objects.  The above example will
return the 20 most numerous object vnums in the game at that time.
~

56 DICEFORMULAS~
To make the special SMAUG spells possible, special dice formula handling
had to be coded in.  (At least to make it nice).  This dice formula code
supports full BEDMAS expressions ( ) ^^ / * + -, plus extra mud related
operators and variables:
 
D dice         L level          H hit points      M mana
V movement     S strength       I intelligence    W wisdom

1 DIG DIGGING BURY BURYING~
Syntax:  dig
Syntax:  dig  <direction>
Syntax:  bury <item>
 
You can dig and bury items through the use of the dig skill and bury command.
Buried items are not visible to players, even through the use of spells such
as locate object.  To dig an item up, type dig with no arguments.  Having a
shovel raises your chance of success.  If you dig in a direction, you will
attempt to dig open an exit.
 
To bury an item (or corpse), drop the item on the ground and bury <item>.
Depending on the size and weight of the object, you might need a shovel.
 
* Note:  Deadly players can bury/dig up each other's corpses. *
 
Items buried will not last beyond crash or reboot.  Do not attempt to use
this skill for storage of items you wish to keep.

-1 DIKU~
.         SMAUG was originally based on the Merc 2.1 code which was
              based on the orignal DIKUMud code created by:

                       The Original DIKUMud Team:

          Katja Nyboe               [Superwoman] (katz@freja.diku.dk)
          Tom Madsen              [Stormbringer] (noop@freja.diku.dk)
          Hans Henrik Staerfeldt           [God] (bombman@freja.diku.dk)
          Michael Seifert                 [Papi] (seifert@freja.diku.dk)
          Sebastian Hammer               [Quinn] (quinn@freja.diku.dk)

                     Additional contributions from:

 Michael Curran  - the player title collection and additional locations.
 Bill Wisner     - for being the first to successfully port the game,
                   uncovering several old bugs, uh, inconsistencies,
                   in the process.

         And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

  The Original DIKUMud was Developed at the Department of Computer Science
                     at the University of Copenhagen.
~

1 DISARM~
Syntax:  disarm
 
Disarm is an auxiliary fighting command to attempt to disarm your opponent.
Several things affect your ability to disarm or resist a disarm attempt
successfully, including your weapon and your stats compared to the weapon
and stats of your opponent.
 
You can only attempt to disarm your primary opponent, meaning you will be
unable to try to disarm a second or third attacker until you have disposed
of the first.
 
~

1 DISCLAIMER~
By continuing to play this MUD you are acknowledging that:
(1)  you are willing to abide by the decisions of the Immortals concerning
all issues involved in the game, and
(2)  conversation and situations may arise during the course of play that 
     may not be suitable for young children.

By these acknowledgments you hereby save and except this MUD and it's
Administrators from any and all liability that may arise during gameplay.
~

51 DISCLAIMER2~
OUR WAY OR THE HIGHWAY
~

1 DISCLOSURE~
Syntax c 'disclosure'
 
This spell will reveal any sneaking or hiding players in the area. However,
it will also reveal the caster.
~

1 DISMISS~
Syntax: dismiss <target>

The dismiss command will force your charmed mobile to follow itself and
will negate the charm effect.
 
~

0 'DISPEL EVIL'~
Syntax: cast 'dispel evil' <victim>
 
This spell invokes the wrath of the gods upon an evil victim.  If you do
not specify a target, the spell's effect will strike you instead of a
secondary target.
~

0 'DISPEL MAGIC'~
Syntax:  cast 'dispel magic' <character>
 
This spell dispels magical affects on the victim.  It may be used as an
offensive spell to remove an enemy's magical advantages, or as a benign
spell to completely remove your own magical affects.
 
If you are not a mage, you must be affected by the 'detect magic' to be
able to use this spell.  Though mages do not necessarily need to use it,
being under the affects of 'detect magic' will reveal more information
unavailable otherwise or to other classes.
 
'Dispel magic' can be used by players and mobiles alike against either
players or mobiles.  It cannot remove affects from equipment, your race
or your deity; some other affects are immune to this spell as well.
 
When a caster successfully casts 'dispel magic' on themself they will
remove all of their dispellable magical affects.  If a mage successfully
dispels a victim, the number of affects stripped will depend on their
success and intelligence.  Otherwise a successful cast of 'dispel magic'
on a victim will result in the removal of a single affect each time
(victims will notice when and what affects are stripped).
 
WARNING:  this is an offensive spell, and its use on anyone other than
yourself will be treated as an attack on your target.
 
~

1 DISRUPTION~
With the spell 'Disruption,' the casting Mage causes his opponent to
be enveloped in a weird energy field that momentarily alters the plane
which the victim inhabits.  The spell was an early attempt by the Dark
Mage Thanatos to cause teleportation, but it was a failed attempt.  
Instead of teleporting it causes a horrendous nerve-wracking pain as
the victim exits and reenters his current plane of existence.
~

1 DIVINITY~
Syntax:  c divinity <target>
 
This spell heals the target of 200 hitpoints of damage.
~

57 DMESG~

51 DND~
On or off syntax: DND
 
This command toggles your personal dnd flag.
This command effectively secludes immortals from those of lower level. 
Each immortal has a personal dnd flag associated with their pfile. In
addition, each room can have a dnd flag associated with the room.
 
When your personal dnd flag is set, lower level imms can't 'at', 'goto',
'trans', sight you on 'where' or 'where (name). This does not affect LD 
immortals, they can still be transferred, even with the DND flag on. To 
see the flag's status, 'mstat self', it will be listed under 'pcflags'.
Syntax for room flag: redit flags DND
 
The DND room flag effectively blocks any 'at', and 'goto' commands
either to the room, or to a mob/object in the room. NOTE: It is only
in effect if:
a) there is an immortal in the room with their DND flag on.
b) the immortal attempting the commands is of lower level than the
   immortal with the activated DND flag in the room.
~

0 DODGE~
Syntax:  operates automatically

you are successful, your opponent's attack misses and you take will
take no damage. Dodge is an automatic skill and requires no weapon.

of etiquette regarding its use are the same.
 
See CHARM
~

1 DONATE DONATION DONATIONS~
The Cathedral of Notre Dame de Sioux, northwest of the Darkhaven Square,
maintains two donation rooms where equipment and items may be left for
the use of the needy.

side of the aisle.  Items placed in the altar itself for donation will
be sorted and placed appropriately by the Cathedral's clerics.
 
~

1 DOORBASH~
Syntax: doorbash <direction>

are affected by this skill.
 
~

53 DOORDIRS~

  | UP        |   4   |
  | DOWN      |   5   |

1 DRAG~
Syntax:  drag  <character> <direction>
 
Drag will drag the victim in the specified direction if they are not
standing up.
 
Deadly characters can drag any other deadly character who is not standing
up, as long as the victim is within the 5-level pkill range.
 
Peaceful characters can drag other peaceful characters only if the target
is stunned, incapacitated or worse.  Peaceful characters cannot drag any
deadly character at any time.  Peacefuls can use 'config +/- drag' to
prevent others from dragging them if they wish.
 
You cannot drag a character into a death trap, or if either you or they
are under attack.

1 'DRAGON CULT'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 25

The Cult of the Dragon worships the apocalypse and death. A highly
religious band, they are continuously trying to recruit new followers
and acolytes. Little more is commonly known about the cult, who keep
to themselves inside their often-deadly tower.
~

1 'DRAGON TOWER'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 30

As the ages pass, the Order of Dragonslayer continues its eternal
struggle against the dragons of Despair. The weaker members of the
draconian race slowly began to die out and were forced to retreat. The
draconians, a breed of half-dragon humanoids, were led by their king
into the Shadow Grove. Within this shadowy land, they erected a towering
structure with the aid many powerful dragons of all colors. The most powerful
of these, the Dragon Queen Tiamat, was later magically banished to the Dragon
Tower by the most powerful Dragonslayer mages.

1 'DROW CITY'~
Recommended level ranges: 15 - 25

Early in Despair's history the elves where all one race, on the side of
good. But Laschte, in his infinite insanity enticed a group of elves
from the village of Misinkii, turning them on the path of darkness and
destruction. He warped them to be haters of light, cruel and warlike,
even upon each other. He then sent one of his children, a demi-goddess
of chaos and arachnids to watch over them and prepare them as fodder
in his war with Brontrel. Llolth took these dark elves into her evil web
of deception and had them build a city beneath the dwarven forest. Four
houses arose admidst the strife and chaos between the drow as they have
now are called. Llolth's priestesses rule over the city preparing them
for the one day they will have vengeance on the surface elves. Lately,
rumors have sprung up about an alliance between Drow City and Shadowport..
 
~

-1 DROW DROWELVES~
Drow are the darker, more evil cousins of Elves.  They were once part of
the happy community of Elves which roam the forests today, but have long
since moved under the ground, building vast subterranean cities and
complex networks of caves.

Drow have black skin and white hair, and are moderately weaker and have
a more slight constitution than average humans.  Still, like all Elves,
they have a slightly higher dexterity than men.

Members of this race specialize in spell casting, and have thus developed
a very high intelligence.  Being creatures of darkness the Drow tend to
fight more proficiently in the darkness, and have innate infravision with
which to discern objects and living things in the absence of light.
 
Drow gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.08
~

0 DRUID DRUIDS~
The druid is a lover and protector of the natural land.  Be it the forests
full of centaurs and deer, the streams full of fish, or the bug-infested
swamps, a druid always strives to protect and preserve nature.  Wielding
mighty spells from the gods themselves, druids strive hard at their work.
 
Strong in wisdom, with a body trained to near perfection by their rugged
lifestyle, a druid has many disciplines upon which to draw.  From powerful
spells of healing which can bring the near dead back to full vigor, to the
ability to mystically create water and food, to the awesome power of nature
which they command in battle via spells able to quake the land and split
the sky, druids demonstrate that mastery of magic is not just a hobby, but
a way of life for them.  Able to face many warriors on almost even footing,
and able to shield themselves nearly as well as some mages, druids are
truly a gifted class.
 
~

1 DUAL WIELD~
Characters with this skill are able to wield two weapons at once.  To
do so, the character must remove any 'held' item and any shield, then
simply wield two weapons.  Characters with strength under 25 may be
unable to dual wield two very heavy weapons.
 
Once two weapons are wielded, the affects of the skill are automatic.
 
~

0 DWARF DWARVES DWARFS~
Dwarves are relatively short (in Human terms), stocky and powerfully-built
creatures.  Long-lived and extremely sturdy, they are known equally as well
for their hardiness as for their cantankerous personalities.  Their thick,
stout frames lend them poor dexterity, but high strength and stamina.  This
race has produced some of the most reknowned fighters.  Dwarves possess the
inherent ability to see in the dark with infravision.
 
Dwarves average from four foot five inches and five feet tall, with dusky
complexions and thick, fur-covered torsos and limbs.  Both men and women
proudly wear and take pride in their beards.
 
Dwarves gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.97.
~

1 'DWARVEN CATACOMBS'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 20

The Dwarven Catacombs were once a series of mines laced with
veins of gold and silver. After many years, they were emptied of all
valuable minerals and abandoned. As time passed, monsters began
to inhabit the forsaken mines. Some even say a dragon has taken up
residence here. It is a well known fact that a cult of templars has
claimed the dark tunnels as their own and has established a stronghold
deep beneath the earth. Among the other rumors told of this land is the
tale of Excalibur: a lost blade of magical might. Most sages believe that
the ancient sword is located elsewhere however...
~

1 'DWARVEN DAYCARE'~
Recommended level range: 1 - 5

The dwarven daycare lies in the southern portion of the Dwarven
Kingdom. It is here that the stout dwarven miners leave their children
for the day while they procure ore in the vast underground mines. A
large number of female dwarves are employed here. Most are nannies,
given the duties of caring for and feeding the children.
~

1 'DWARVEN VILLAGE'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 35

The ancient dwarven race resides in this village far below the ground.
The stocky dwarves make a handsome living by selling the gold and
silver found in their mines. They have grown accustomed to humans
over the years and now invite the companionship of 'the big people.'
~

0 DYLAN 'DYLAN AREA' 'DYLANS AREA'~
Recommended level range: 15 - 25
 
Clouds have plagued the skies south of Darkhaven since the dawn of Despair. 
None know the cause of this, but many speculate that the vicious harpies and 
air elementals who rule these skies weave the clouds through powerful magic. 
It provides both races with a haven and also camouflage for hiding from 
predators and sneaking up on prey. Thankfully, these beings never descend 
from the skies and assail the races of Light.
~

0 EARTHQUAKE~
Syntax: cast 'earthquake'

This spell inflicts damage on every enemy character in the room.
Beware that other characters who are not yet fighting may attack
you as a result!

         eat   <object> <container>      (eat directly from a container)
 
Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.
 
When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or mana back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not an Avatar, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.
 
See MENTALSTATES
~

1 EATING DRINKING HUNGER THIRST~
Eating and drinking are very important...
 
If you let yourself starve or dehydrate, your mental state will be affected,
and you may have problems performing even the simplest of tasks.
 
Typing 'score' will give you an indication of your current mental state.
('oldscore' will also show this information)
 
Sitting, resting and sleeping will increasingly contribute to better your
mental state (if done while not starving/dehydrating).
 
Being hurt badly in battle ("That really did HURT", and "You wish that your
wounds would stop BLEEDING so much!") as well as poisoning will also have a
rapid negative affect on your mental state.

52 ECHO RECHO~
Syntax:  echo      <color> <message>
         echo  imm <color> <message>
         echo  pc  <color> <message>
Syntax:  recho     <color> <message>
 
ECHO sends a message to all players in the game, without any prefix indicating
who sent it.  If 'echo imm <message>' is used, only level 51+ characters will 
see the message. If 'echo pc <message>' is used, only player characters will 
see the message. Echos should always adhere to the guidelines laid out in the 
Realm of Order (vnum 1214).
 
ECHO done in color should avoid the use of red and dark red unless it is a 
Urgent message containing important information related to the game.

RECHO sends a message to all players in your room, without any prefix
indicating who sent it.

~

51 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.
 
See ASET, FOLDAREA

1 'ELEMENTAL CANYON'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 30

The immense elemental canyon lies on the southern border of the dark
dwarven forest. Once, long ago, the canyon was a flat portion of the
forest, yet the workings of a powerful elder mage destroyed the
landscape surrounding his, or her, home. As a backlash from his
wielding of elemental magics, strange entities formed of the very
elements were formed. These magical beings staked out land in the
newly created canyon and now wage a war amonst each other. Little
else is known about these eerie beings and their war, for none have
ever managed to communicate with the inhabitants of the canyon.

0 ELF ELVES~
Tall, slender creatures with an affinity for the woods and nature, Elves
are distant cousins to the Pixies and share the intelligence and dexterity
of that winged race to a lesser degree.  With a lighter frame than Humans,
what they lack in strength and stamina is made up for with their superior
agility - both in thought and movement.  Elves are capable in all classes,
though they function poorest in the role of pure fighter.  Most Elves will
prefer to stay close to nature, and many become druids.  All Elves have
the inherent ability to detect magic.
 
The average Elf stands taller than most Humans, being well over six feet.
Most have fair skin and long, straight hair, though there are individual
Elves who chose a darker life reflected in their outward appearance.
 
Elves gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.1.

51 EXITMAKING~
The 'redit exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
Currently there can only be one exit in a certain direction.
The syntax of the 'redit exit' command is as follows:
redit exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'redit exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
redit exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
redit exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
redit exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
redit exit n                - Removes the north exit

    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way

       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat

0 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL PORTAL' 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL'~
The Great Wizard Thanatos, after creating his fabled WarMagicks,
found himself snubbed and abused in and about The Realms for his
researches.  Much time would pass before mages and other classes
alike would learn the true power of these spells.
 
In the interim, disguised as an assassin, Thanatos became interested
in a more minor problem: that of carrying off the loot he gained
from all those he slew with Quantum Spike.  Realising that such a
formula would be easily grasped by his class, he thought to extend
it freely.
 
As a final touch to the spell, he thought he would spite those of
other classes by inbuing into these containers a quality which made
them unobtainable by the other classes.

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep

falling from in the air, and allows you to move over water and through the
air.

begin losing hps <hitpoints>, you should cast float immediately.
~

57 'FLOAT'~
Syntax:  cast 'float' <character>
 
The spell enables the target character to float.  It is useful in saving
mv (movement points), as well as in preventing damage taken when falling
and in preventing an opponent from tripping you.  It does not allow you
to travel through areas which require you to fly, however.
~

0 FLY~
Syntax:  cast 'fly' <character>
 
This spell enables the target character to fly.  It is useful in saving
mv (movement points), preventing a character from falling when in the
air, moving over water or through the air, and in preventing an opponent
from tripping you.
 
Some water areas require the use of fly to prevent damage from drowning.
If you are in an area and your movement suddenly begins to drop, then you
begin losing hps <hitpoints>, you should cast fly immediately.
~

56 FOLDAREA~
Syntax:  foldarea <area filename>
 
This command saves an area file, usually after modification.
 
&rThis command must be used with extreme care.  If you aren't
exactly and intimately familiar with the changes being made
or what the command does -- don't use it.&w
 
*NOTE* 
Area files have backups that record the file as it was prior to foldarea.
If you folda something and realize there's a mistake, and you've only
folded it once -- don't do anything else.  Post a note or find Blodkai.
 
Do not fold changes into non-quest areas that are quest related.  If you
must do this, write a note or ensure it's changed back.
 
Any time an area is folded, document it with the fixed command.
(check 'help fixed')
 
See ASET, UNFOLDAREA and INSTALLAREA.

54 FORCECLOSE~
Syntax: forceclose <descriptor>

for it, but high demons, and guardian vampires themselves, like it a lot.
~

61 GFIGHTING~
-----------------------------------------------------------
 
     SYNTAX: gfighting
             gfighting <low> <high>
             gfighting <low> <high> mobs
 
DESCRIPTION: The GFIGHTING command does a global search 
             for the fighting targets specified, where 
             <low> <high> indicates the target's level.
 
    EXAMPLE: gfighting 1 5 would display a list of PCs 
             levels one through five that are fighting, 
             who they are fighting and their level, what 
             vnum/room name they are fighting in, and the 
             name of the area they are fighting in. By 
             adding the 'mobs' variable, the command 
             would display the same information for mobs 
             of the levels specified.
 
-----------------------------------------------------------
~

0 GITH~
The Gith are a race descended from humans.  Once long ago, they were a
peaceful civilization of humans that were captured by mind flayers and
tormented for centuries.  Eventually, a savior named Gith led them to
freedom, yet their bodies had been flayed by the mental powers of the
illithids.  The Gith found themselves, stronger, quicker, luckier and
smarter than average humans, yet they had lost much of their faith,
wisdom, stamina and charisma.
 
They had yellowed skin and were very long of limb.  Sunken eyes peered
from yellowed sockets, now strangely capable of naturally detecting
invisible things.  The Gith race has split into three distinct groups
recently.  The good, the Githzerai, the selfish neutral, the Pirates
of Gith, and the evil, the Githyanki.
 
Gith gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.06.
~

1 GLANCE~
syntax:  glance
syntax:  glance <victim>
 
Glance alone shows you only the contents of the room you are in,
eliminating the description.  Glance <victim> shows only the health
condition, eliminating their description and equipment from your
screen.
 
Glance may be abbreviated as 'gl'.
~

0 GLORY~
Glory is a measure of how valiant you are, and is accumulated by taking part
in quests (mostly) and possibly in a few other ways in the near to distant
future.  It appears on your score screen as:
 
                    Glory: 264(430)
 
  The number in parentheses is the total lifetime glory attained by your
character, and the other number is your current glory.  Glory can be "spent"
to improve your items and weapons (among possible other things in the future)
as according to the scale detailed in HELP GLORY RATES.
 
   Unlike Quest Points of old, Glory will not only go to the "winner" of the
quest, but will be awarded on a basis of participation.  For example, the big
prize might not only go to the person who killed the monster,  but also to
the person who solved the riddle first, etc.  Players who took part in the
quest and helped a notable amount will also recieve lesser amounts of Glory.
 
   Glory cannot be traded or transferred between characters.  This would be
like Odysseus passing all the reknown for his deeds off onto someone else.

0 'GLORY TRADE'~
. Glory is a trait inherent in a character, and as such will not under any
circumstances be moved from one player to another.
  On a similar note, Glory is cashed in as per GLORY RATES, on an all or
nothing basis.  Glory will NOT be taken from more than one character in order
to buy an affect.

~

51 GLORYIMM~
Somethings to keep in mind when giving/taking Glory:
 
  - Glory is UNtradable between mortals.  (Please do not facilitate trades of
         Glory between mortals.
  - It is allowed for a player to use his Glory to affect items for another
         player.
  - Currently, appropriate prizes to be awarded for quests are as follows:
 
  Avatar quests (lvl 40+):
         Suggested Maximum:  50 Glory  (For playing an integral part)
         Suggested Minimum:   5 Glory  (For making a notable effort)
    - Then Glory of appropriate amounts (use your judgement) can be given out
         for intermediate efforts between winning and participating.
 
  NOTE:  Being integral doesn't neccessarily mean landing the killing blow on
         the supermob, it might also mean the person who solved the riddle
         leading to the mob (if it was a difficult riddle).
  NOTE:  Prizes should be scaled up or down to reflect the difficulty and
         participation of the quest.  For example a difficult quest would be
         one that takes more than 2 hours to complete.
 
  Non-Avatar quests (lvl < 40):
         Suggested Maximum:  35 Glory  (For an integral part)
         Suggested Minimum:   5 Glory  (For a notable effort)
See also: GLORYIMM2, QPSET, GLORY, GLORY RATES.
~

51 GLORYIMM2~
.    Glory does not neccessarily have to be the only prize given out.  In fact
     for the lower level quests it is preferred if a combination of Glory and
     minorly affected/renamed objects are given out as prizes.  i.e. a weapon
     renamed to something related to the quest that has a couple +1's or +2's
     on it (that will be useful for a couple levels, but then discarded).
 
     NOTE:  It is suggested for Guild and Order quests that the prizes be
            scaled down slightly as participation is limited from the entire
            mud - and open exclusively to guild/order members.  The quests they
            recieve from the guild/order are supplemental to the mud-wide ones
            they can participate in.
 
 
     DISCLAIMER:  These numbers are not set in stone, they are guidelines.  The
                  QC is counting on the good judgement of the immortals to
                  make sure the prizes they are giving out are appropriate.
                  The QC reserves the right to change the guidelines as well
                  the right to set them in stone if we find it is being abused.

-1 GNOME GNOMES~
Gnomes are a quirky demi-human race.  Though not the mightiest of
races, they are well versed in their studies of knowledges, magics
and religions.  Additionally, due to their familiarity with such
lore, they tend to be more resistant to magics.  They can, though,
suffer tremendously from physical attacks.

Gnomes usually focus in the magical or clerical arts, though a few
rogues have ventured into the arts of thieving (albeit often not
very well.)

Gnomes are a short, stocky race, similar to their dwarven cousins.
Most often prefer an evening at home with a magical tome, a loaf of
pipeweed bread and a cup of ale over venturing out to battle.

Gnomes gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.2

1 GRASP 'GRASP SUSPIRIA'~
Syntax:  grasp
 
The suspiric grasp is the vampire's most lethal attack, allowing it to
drain the life of its opponent in larger quantities than nearly any
other skill or spell in the Realms.  The more intelligent is the
vampire, the more effectively it will perform this loathsome act.  Be
aware that the magical nature of this attack causes it to be affected
by the victim's saves.
 
~

1 GRAVEYARD~
Recommended level range: 5 - 10

Darkhaven's graveyard was once a peaceful burial ground, visited by
grieving citizens and tended by gentle priests. However, a powerful
curse was cast upon this land by an unknown mage. Within days, the
soft brown earth had turned black and sooty. A year later, the dead
began to claw their way out of the earth, roaming the graveyard in
search of flesh. Though many have tried to lift the curse on this
small plot of land, none of these attempts have succeeded. Some sages
believe that an elder God of evil protects the curse of the graveyard.
~

1 'GREAT EASTERN DESERT'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 20
 
The Great Eastern Desert lies far to the east of Darkhaven, just south
of the majestic New Thalos. It is a barren wasteland, inhabitated only
by nomads and desert wildlife. Those who have found shelter from the
sweltering sun often describe an encounter with a great brass dragon who
resides in a chamber which prevents the usage of magic...

63 'GROUP DISPLAYER'~
~

1 GROUP GROUPING~
Syntax:  group <character>, group all, group, group disband
 
'Group <character>' adds someone who is following you into your group, making
them a group member.  Group members share experience from kills, and may use
the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will
automatically join the fight.
 
If character is already a member of your group, 'group <character>' again to
remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group does not
stop them from following you, however.  A character can also leave a group
by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they will both leave your
group and stop following you.
 
'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
'Group all' groups all eligible players following you in the room.
 
'Group disband' allows the leader to disband his group (members will stop
following and are ungrouped).
 
You may group only characters within eight levels of your own.  See section
10 of your Adventurer's Guide for more information on groups and grouping.

                                      Pkill
 
Here are some sample uses of GRUB:
 
grub 20 pkill=y class=5      Display 20 Druid pkillers
grub 20 level=2 last<=970120 Display 20 L2 players absent since 970120
grub 20 level>=20 level<=30  Display 20 players levels 20 thru 30
grub  0 level=2              Count the number of level 2 players
grub 20 level>50 gold>100000 Display 20 imms with more than 100k gold
grub 50 damroll>100 sex=2    Display 50 females with damroll>150
grub  0 class=5 damroll>150  Count the number of druids with damroll>100
grub 20 site<>123.456.789    Display 20 players from site 123.456.789
grub 10 class=0 race=2       Display 10 dwarven mages
grub  1 name=Joe             Display Joe's info
grub 20 room=7070 class=0    Display 20 mages who logged off in 7070
grub  0 class!=2 class!=3 class!=4   Count the number of mana users
 
You always need to specify the number of lines you want displayed. The
reason for that is that we don't want to ask for a list and then get
surprised to find that it's 15,000 lines long. You can get a count
of the players that match your criteria by requesting zero lines.
 
GRUB will tell you how many lines there are in the list no matter how
many you ask to display. So if there are 15,000 players that meet your
criteria and you ask for the first ten, GRUB will tell you there are
15,000 in total but will only show you the first ten.

~

51 'GRUB EXAMPLES'~
Here are some examples illustrating common usages:
 
Example:
 
grub 20 or hitroll>150 damroll>150 gold>200000000
 
Suppose you want to search for "suspicious players". Suppose you want
to see players who have more than 200 million gold or whose damroll
exceeds 150 or whose hitroll exceeds 150 you can do that as follows:
 
Normally GRUB lists players who satisfy all the conditions you specify.
But it can also be used like this to list players who satisfy any one of
the conditions.
 
The operand "or" ensures GRUB will list players who satisfy any one of
the conditions.
 
If you had specified:
 
grub 20 hitroll>150 damroll>150 gold>200000000
 
That would show you players whose hitroll exceeds 150 and whose damroll
exceeds 150 and whose gold exceeds 200 million. It would be a much
smaller list and you would miss many suspicous players.
 
Example:
 
grub 20 name>ska name<skb room>=21000 room<=21499
 
Suppose someone complains that a player with a name like "Skathamaga"
picked up some of their eq and promptly quit the game. The player isn't
sure of the exact name of the thief but is sure it starts with "Ska".
The thief quit the game somewhere in New Darkhaven (vnums 21000-21499).
 
This example will show you players whose name starts with "Ska" and who
last quit the mud somewhere in New Darkhaven.

         10 Gith&w
&GYou can have more than one conditional expression in a Grub search. "And" is
assumed unless "or" is placed before the arguements. ie:
&W    Grub 10    class=3 sex=2    (Gives back a list of 10 female warriors)
    Grub 10 or class=3 sex=2    (Gives back a list of 10 characters that
                                 are either female, or warriors).
You must always specify how many lines the Grub will produce. This prevents
your getting a list 15000+ lines long.

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.
 
SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.
 
TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.
 
REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.

2 GUILD GUILDS~
Guilds are special organizations for each class within the realms. Belonging
to a Guild has many advantages, such as gaining new knowledge of your class,
making new friends in the Realms, exciting quests, the great feeling of 
helping other players, and many other aspects of Guild life make being in a
Guild a memorable experience.  Each Guild has its own separate headquarter
with a healer, a practice room, a Guild store, and many other rooms that makes
each Guild unique unto itself.
 
Membership in a Guild is not something that is easily obtained, and you must
be a law-abiding player.  Deadly players are not allowed to join Guilds.
There are rules within each Guild, and along with these rules, you must
follow the rules of this MUD.
 
To gain entry into a Guild, you should speak with a leader of the Guild.  The
leaders are those people who have the title <Leader>, <First> and <Second>.
To find out who is on from a Guild, type "who 'Guild of *****'.  For example,
if you are a Druid, and you wish to find out who is on from the Guild of 
Druids, type "who 'Guild of Druids'", and you will be given a list of players
that belong to the Guild.
 
Type &Ghelp guild rules&w for a list of rules about Guild equiment and items.
~

2 'GUILD RULES'~
.
&RIt is illegal to sell, trade, auction or give away Guild items.&w Including
potions, pills, scrolls, equipment and containers.  Anything you can buy in
a Guild house is off limits for selling.  If you are found to be trading in
these illegal items, you stand the chance of not only being outcast from your
Guild, but your Guild may lose the ability to sell those items.
 
Please do not engage in buying such items either, as the Immortals reserve
the right to remove Guild items from ANY person not belonging to that Guild.
Just because you can buy it on the "black market" does not mean the Immortals
will allow you to keep it.
 
If you are in doubt whether an item is a Guild item, you are free to ask an
Immortal. Most Guild items have the name "guild" on it when you use identify.
 
There are rules that are specific to Guilds.  If you are not sure if something
is legal or illegal within your Guild, please contact a leader.

0 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALFELVES~
These beautiful creatures are the result of the mixing of human and Elven
blood.  Though the resulting Half-Elf is not as intelligent as the pure-
blooded Elf, nor as hardy as the full-blooded Human, this mix serves quite
well in a variety of classes which require the standards of both mental
and physical prowess.  Their beautiful almond eyes enable them to discern
objects in the darkness.
 
Not as tall as the pure Elf, they range from five feet six inches to six
feet five inches, with a heavier musculature than their ancestors.
 
Half-Elves gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.04.
~

0 HALF-OGRE HALFOGRE~
The Half-Ogre is a result of breeding during the dark days with humans,
when pure-blooded Ogres were known for raping and looting Human villages.
As a result of this, the Half-Ogre stands from six to nine feet tall in
height and is known for its muscle-packed body that can weigh from three
to four hundred pounds.  Most are relatively hairless, their bodies are
covered with small, boney growths, and their disproportionately long
limbs gives them a somewhat simian appearance.
 
This offspring of humans and Ogres has inherited great physical abilities:
an apptitude for aggression from its Ogre lineage, inherent infravision to
assist in traversing darkness, and though slightly smaller than pure-bred
Ogres it nevertheless boasts an awesome strength.  Being territorial, most
Half-Ogres will readily engage in battle to establish superiority over any
it encounters.  All in all a race best suited for the role of pure fighter.
 
Half-Ogres gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.92.
~

0 HALF-ORC HALF-ORCS HALFORC HALFORCS~
A recent mingling of Orcish and Human blood arising as the darker races
have encroached further upon the remaining settled areas, most members
of this half-blooded race are distinctly more Orcish than Human in both
appearance and behavior.  Large and dull of wit, with short but broad
bodies, their poor mental and physical dexterity is offset by an iron
constitution.  Though some have dabbled in the sorcerous arts due to
their human influence, brute combat is is still the natural call which
stirs in the soul of the Half-Orc.  All Half-Orcs possess infravision.
 
Though not as broad nor powerful as full-blood Orcs, Half-Orcs usually
retain their wider bodies, longer, bowed limbs and heavier musculature.
A ridged brow crowned by bushy eyebrows conceals small, squinting eyes;
below a snout-like noses opens a maw filled with crooked fangs; dark
skin emanating a rancid odor; their presence disgusts civilized races.
Standing from five to seven feet tall and averaging two hundred pounds,
an altogether fearsome race.
 
Half-Orc's gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.94.
~

0 HALF-TROLL HALFTROLL~
An intermingling (carried out in the darker lands of the Realms) of the
blood of the Troll with that of Humans, the Half-troll is as deadly as
it is hideous.  Though considerably smaller than full-blood Trolls, the
Half-troll often stands well over eight feet in height and carries over
three hundred pounds on its heavily-muscled frame.  Though naturally of
low wisdom, the race was sorcerously imbued with a wicked intelligence
and the ability to see naturally in the darkness.  Half-trolls usually
make poor pure magic users, and suffer from an unusually low dexterity.
Yet their boundless energy and high intellect create one of the most
cunning physical beasts of the Realms in experienced hands.
 
Owing in part to the black blood which courses through their heavy veins,
the heavily-scaled skin of the Half-troll ranges in color from a charcoal
grey to a deep, blackish green.  Half-trolls revel in the fright of their
appearance, often wearing their hair in battle-braids and emblazoning
themselves with brands and tattoos to accentuate the effect.
 
Half-Trolls gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.90.
~

0 HALFLING HALFLINGS~
Stout, round, open-minded and very elusive the Hobbit has a level
of dexterity which is only equal to his wit. Many enjoy the thrill of
reading a good book, or telling stories by the fire. Many halflings,
because of this, tend to avoid adventuring, though some rare hobbits
choose the path of the Bard, or storyteller, for their keen intellect
serves them well. This intelligence, coupled by a surprising
determination makes them a curious (though somewhat underpowered)
ally.

Halflings have compact bodies and thick, long limbs, and usually have
very hairy feet. Eye color range from blue, brown, green, and any shade
inbetween.

Halflings gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 1.02.

1 'HAON DOR'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 10

The immense forest of Haon Dor stretches westward from Darkhaven,
swallowing much of Despair's western landscape. It is a dangerous
forest, populated by many aggressive creatures: wargs and wolves
among them. A single beast rules the forest, given the name Froghemoth
by those who have survived its wrath. Obvious paths to the Shire,
Troll Den, Old Marsh and the city of Solace can be found in Haon Dor,
as well as hidden ones to various other places in Despair.
~

1 'HAUNTED HOUSE'~
Recommended level range: 20 - 50
 
Should you stumble into a lonely inn one night, seeking a hot meal and a place
to rest, it is quite possible that you will hear a bard tell the story of a
strange, mystical house that was inhabited by an evil, eccentric sorceror.
Murdered by one of the very beasts he created, the house was left abandoned
to be overrun by the strange beings spawned by the sorceror.  It is rumoured
that the house even nowadays remains haunted by these odd, powerful creatures.
The house now lies in the midst of the Midway of Despair, open for all those
adventurers who are brave (or foolish) enough to enter.

Headbutt is a skill which can only be used once a fight has started,
and can only be used against your primary opponent.  If it successfully
lands, it inflicts damage on your opponent.
~

54 HEDIT~
Syntax: hedit [help topic]
 
This command allows you to edit a help topic.  If the specified help topic
does not exist, it will be created for you. The default help page (summary)
will be selected if you do not specify a page.
 
NOTE - Always, when creating a new help entry, type Help <new entry name> 
       prior to creating your entry. A pre-existing help file associated 
       with that keyword may already exist.
&Y
Colors &wcan now be added to help files using the same command set that changes
a player's prompt. &bMultiple &Ycolor &wcombinations can be set on a given line
including ^bbackground^x colors. However there are a couple of quirks to take 
note of:
&Y
    1) At the very least, the first character of a help file cannot be
       either the symbol '&&' or the symbol '^^'.
    2) Color changes have to be separated by at least one character. ie,
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' will cause problems. 
    3) Color codes are imbedded within text and _do_ count in note buffers
       for line length. ie, watch out for <Long Line Trimmed>.
&w
Colors should be used to &Yenhance &wthe help file, or specific parts of the 
help file. Tact and restraint should be used if considering the use of colors.
 
 
See HSET, PCOLORS.
~

51 HELL UNHELL~
Syntax: hell <character> <number> <hours or days>
Syntax: unhell <character>
 
The hell command sends a character to hell for a given period of time.  It
automatically releases the character when their time has been served.  Upon
being helled, the character receives the message, "The immortals are not
pleased with your actions.  You shall remain in hell for <time period>".
 
Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours".  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.
 
You may not hell someone for more than thirty days with the hell command.
 
To release a player from hell, simply "unhell <character>".

1 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax:  hide
Syntax:  sneak
Syntax:  visible
 
If you successfully hide, creatures cannot see you unless they are affected
by 'detect hidden'.  Player characters can detect you, however.
 
If you successfully sneak, you can move from place to place without being
noticed by other player characters.  If you flee, you will stop sneaking
and will have to 'sneak' again.
 
In order to either hide or sneak successfully, you will have to practice
the appropriate skill.
 
Visible (vis) cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
effectively making you visible again to all.

1 'HIGH TOWER OF SORCERY'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 30

Ages ago, when the mortals of Despair were still experimenting with
magic, a coven of archmages deemed that the use of magic needed to
be learned and controlled to avoid terrible disasters. Thus the Guild
of Mages was created, along with the High Tower of Sorcery. After
many attacks from the beings of Darkness, the mages also found it
necessary to weave a powerful grove of shadows around the Tower, so
that only the stoutest adventurers could reach them. Since that time,
the mages of Despair, led by the powerful Mistress of Magic, have
attempted to grasp the idea of magic and understand how it truly works.
Recently, the Guild has gained such respect that Duke Luther has
permitted the building of a Tower of Sorcery in Darkhaven.
~

51 HITALL~
Syntax: hitall
 
Hitall is a fighter skill that will start a fight by hitting all the
opponents in the room.  For nondeadly characters, the 'opponents' means
mobs, for deadlies it means all the deadly players in the room.
 
Be aware that area attacks are aggressive to all mobs in the room,
including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.

1 HLIST~
Syntax: hlist <low level range> <high level range>
 
This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list
is in alphabetical order based on the first triggering keyword. While
this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.

51 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.

 level <level> <help topic>      Sets help topic to specified level
 keyword <keyword> <help topic>  Sets help keyword to specified keyword
 remove <level.><help topic>     Removes the specified help page
 
Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in spellcasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

Setting a help entry level to -1 prevents the header from showing up 
when you view the help with the help command.

1 IGNORE~
Syntax:  ignore
Syntax:  ignore <character>
Syntax:  ignore reply/none
 
Ignore allows you to ignore other characters in the Realms.  All tells,
says, socials, and emotes from these characters will be blocked (gagged
out).  You will still see their communications through public channels,
however.
 
Simply typing ignore will give you a list of all the characters you are
currently ignoring.
 
Ignore <character> allows you to add or remove a character from your list
of ignored players.  If the name is already on the list it will be removed.
If the name is not on the list it will be added.  Note that only the names
of actual characters will be accepted and that it is not necessary for
them to be logged on at the time.
 
Ignore reply will cause you to ignore the last person to send you a tell.
This can be used to prevent invisible people from spamming you.
 
Ignore none will set you to ignoring no one.
 
~

1 'ILL FORTUNE'~
Syntax: c 'ill fortune' <victim>
 
Ill Fortune reduces the victim's luck by three.

Associated help files: Bodybag && CR
 
- You are never required to do a CR for a mortal.
- If you do perform an Immortal CR, you are required to take at least one
  item as charge, this item should be one of the best items the player has.
  ** The only exceptions are a CR for a person under level 10 or if you are
  ** running a quest, and the player died in that quest or you have the
  ** approval from a Council of Elders member.  These qualify for a free CR.
- You may never give free CRs to your friends or for your own mortals.
- You may choose more then one item or gold for a CR, but _must_ inform the
  player of your intent prior to bodybagging them.
- You are never allowed to do a cr for a deadly character.
- Corpses should be at least "crawling with vermin" prior to receiving an
  Immortal CR, i.e. a corpse timer of less then 20.

You may never CR for your own mortal unless _all_ the following apply:
   - There is no other Immortal online to do it for you.
   - You have tried to get your corpse on your own, with mortal assistance.
   - Your corpse is in "the last stages of decay", meaning you cannot wait
     any longer, i.e. a corpse timer of less than 8.

If you perform a CR for one of your -own- mortal characters, you must:
   - Take at least one of the better/best items from your mortal, and eat it.
   - Post a note on 1220 stating that you cr'd your own mortal's corpse.
 
***** See 'help timer' to get a list of corpse decay timer and messages.

51 'IMM ECHO'~
Associated help files: echo

Echos should generally be medieval in nature, and their use confined
primarily to administrative functions, weddings, quest, role-playing
and the like.  Role-playing should be used rarely, however.
 
Though there is some leeway within these guidelines, some practices
are frowned upon and should be avoided.  Do not use your name in an echo
unless necessary.  Avoid comical phrases or 'cutsey' terms.  Do not use
:) or other symbols/punctuations at all.
 
If any of the above are necessary, there exist a sufficient number of
public channels via which the task can be accomplished while still
reaching a wide audience -  without forcing it onto the screen of
every character in the game.
~

51 'IMM EQUIP~
.                       Equipment Usage
                       ---------------
**  All equipment worn by an immortal must be made from vnum 1222.
**  No stats or affects may be added to vnum 1222.
**  If you need to test your mobs, you may make a weapon with the
    stats needed to test your mob.
~

51 'IMM FORCE'~
Associated help files: force
 
This command allows you to make someone execute a command.  Forcing
someone can often be looked at as high-handed.  Most common use of
force is to make someone do something as you are snooping, to check
problems or bugs, without waiting having to tell the character exactly
what to type.  It is always best to ask the person before you begin
forcing them.  You may also use force to make a player quit, drop,
or read something when you are punishing them.  
 
Force all <command> can be done, but causes excessive lag because it
causes every player lower than you to attempt the command.  This should
be reserved to "force all save" in times of numerous crashes.  You should
never force all to use a channel.
~

51 'IMM FORCECLOSE'~
Associated help files: forceclose
 
This command will force a certain descriptor to close.  To use, you
must first look for the number listed under Desc on the user list.
Then type: forceclose <Desc #>
 
You can use forceclose to knock a trouble player offline, as well as
knock off someone who it stuck online.
~

51 'IMM FREEZE'~
Associated help files: help freeze
 
Syntax: deny         <character>
Syntax: disconnect   <character>
Syntax: freeze       <character>
 
DENY denies access to a particular player and throws them out of the game.  
Deny is permanent (persists across reboots) and is not undoable from within
the game.  Only someone with access to the player files directory may repeal
a DENY by editing the appropriate player file.
 
DISCONNECT <character> immediately disconnects that character.
 
FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all.
~

51 'IMM GOTO'~
Syntax: goto <name>

This is a reminder to use common courtesy when using such commands
as goto.   Not only is it considered inappropriate to goto higher
level immortals without asking permission, the same could be said
when wanting to visit any player on the mud.  A quick tell requesting
to visit would suffice.  For those of you who frequent headquarters,
either Clans, Guilds or Orders, requesting permission, though not
necessary, is certainly welcome.  Note that if a mortal requests that
you leave their hq, and you have no pressing business, you are obligated
to abide by their wishes.  (This does not apply to high ranking immortals.)
 
~

51 'IMM INVIS'~
Associated help files: invis and wizinvis
 
Those Immortals between levels 51 and 54 may invis to level 51 when they
are running or preparing a quest, involved in a building projects that
requires you to be uninterrupted, or you are actively watching a mortal.
At all other times, the Immortal should be visible to all levels of mortals
and Immortals.  Wizinvis is to be used as a tool to assist you in your duties
as an Immortal, it is not a means to spy on others or hide.
 
Immortals of level 55 and above may use wizinvis beyond 51 to work on
projects or monitor another person.  It is mandatory to be visible to all
other immortals whenever reasonably able to do so.  Keep the use of
"Someone" to a minimum on channels.  Exceptions are when you need to answer
a question, make a comment, or pass on some information, but are too busy
to become visible.
~

51 'IMM RECHO'~
Associated help files: recho
 
Rechos should generally be medieval in nature, and their use confined
primarily to administrative functions, weddings, quest, role-playing
and the like.  Recho can be seen by all players in one room.  Do not 
use recho to "scare" mortals.  Recho is seen on logs, be cautious in
using them in social/private situations.
~

51 'IMM SNOOP'~
Associated help files: snoop

The snoop command is a very valuable tool, when used appropriately.  Snoop
not only allows you to watch another person, but to see the world through
their eyes, helping to track down problems the person may be experiencing.
The reasons for snooping are too varied to mention here, but the reasons
NOT to snoop are easily listed.
 
-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
   snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- If a higher level Immortals requests you to stop snooping, do so quickly.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded.
    ** For example, you learn someone is having a mud affair from snoop.
    ** This information has nothing to do with the reason you are snooping
    ** and should not affect your judgement.  It should not be passed on.
-- Being an Immortal is a privilege and a job.  Snoop is a tool to assist
   you do your job properly.  Snoop is neither a toy nor a right.
~

51 IMMAUTH AUTH AUTHORIZE~
Associated help file: Authorize
 
Syntax: authorize <name> <yes|name|no/deny>
 
Authorize is used to allow a new player to start his or her character.
Names must not be offensive or similar to an existing immortal (within a
letter or two).  Names like "Braveheart" are acceptable even though they
are not normally considered "proper" names.  Players are allowed to use
names of mobs ... but not extremely popular mobs.
Use your best judgement when authorizing a name.
 
You may use the abbreviation "a" for authorize and the abbreviation "n" 
for name.  In addition, you only need to type as much of a name to uniquely
identify it.
 
So, for example, if Goixetoika is awaiting authorization,

a                shows pending authorizations
a g              allows the name
a g n            requires player to change name
a g no           denies name and forces player off (offensive name)
~

55 IMMHOST~
Syntax:  immhost add    <name> <host>
Syntax:  immhost delete <name> <host>
Syntax:  immhost save
Syntax:  immhost
This command is for setting the hosts allowed for immortals that are added
with this command.  Wildcards are allowed (*), so *edu, would allow any domain
from edu connect and 127*, would allow any local domain to connect.
IMMHOST without arguments will show a list of names and what domains they are
allowed to connect from.
To delete a command you need to provide the name and the host, this allows
for multiple hosts for a certain name.
This file won't be saved until the immhost save command is issued.

 &W*&G It is expected that no Imm will be multi-playing their imm while they
   are questing.  This includes multi-playing while invis/afk/etc.
 
 &W*&G It is expected that no imm will log off their imm character in order to

   QC imm is stranded running the quest and fielding everything else.
 
 &W*&G You may &CNOT&G quest if you log in with your imm at any time during
   the quest.
 
&WSo when can you quest?&G
 
 &W*&G It's somewhat limiting, but you can quest &CIF&G you happen to be 
   morting when a quest begins, &COR&G if you are given the explicit
   permission of the imm running the quest. &CPlease do not pressure them.&G
 
 
Immortals can apply once a month for a rename scroll or twenty glory.
Phalanx, on behalf of the Quest Council, and Elcid on behalf of the
Symposium are responsible for the distribution of the monthly 'payments.'
To apply for your monthly rename or share of glory, post a note on 1203

The skies above Darkhaven are unpopulated save for the amusing
faerie dragons. Wild rumors say that a portal to the Astral Plane
exists at the end of a rainbow high above the city.
~

1 INCONNU~
The ancient Inconnu strive endlessly to attain Golconda, the personal
perfection of knowledge, ability, and control over the bestial self.
The mastery of one aspect serves only to mark a beginning anew of the
trek for perfection down new paths.  Largely indifferent to joy or
sorrow, pleasure or pain, and choosing to live in relative seclusion
from the world they often despise, the Inconnu care little for their
lesser brethren yet harbor no inherent desire to bring harm.  Slow to
anger, but formidable when aroused, their elder status and power
affords them an uncommon respect.

~

1 INT INTELLIGENCE~
Intelligence (INT in your 'score') represents your character's mental
capacity.  Among other things, it affects:
 
 - heavily influences the amount of mana a character gains at level
 
 - affects the amount of mana regenerated or recovered at each tick
   if a character is resting or sleeping
 
 - the rate at which a character learns a new skill or spell
 
 - the percentage rate at which a character practices a new language
 
Intelligence is an important factor in learning between combatants.  If
a character fights a creature several times, the more intelligent of the
two opponents will gain an advantage over time...
 
Intelligence is the prime attribute of the mage.
 
~

0 INVIS 'MASS INVIS'~
Syntax: cast invis <character>

Ipcompare will compare online users to search for multiplayers. A positive
match using ipcompare does not always mean it is a multiplayer..but shows
that there are more than one user from a site on simultaneously.
Ipcompare <field> <#> will limit the output to x number of lines based on #.
* may be used as a wild card, for example ipcompare 207.18.3.* will return
matches from any that begin with the ip prior to the asterisk.
Ipcompare <field> <room|area|world> will limit the search based on that
criteria.  The room|area|world limitation will be judged on the room that
the immortal issued the command in.  So if you are in a different area
than the victim, it will show only players matching the site in the area
you are in.

death of another player. Only situations which involve peacefuls being

in the assignment of this flag. You will receive a &PKiller &Wflag if:

  To help prevent yourself from acquiring a &PKiller &Wflag after being
  attacked, set yourself to &YConfig +Nice &W(See &CHelp Config &Wfor info).
 
  2. You were the Master of a mobile which killed another player while
  under the influence of your charm. PLEASE NOTE that you will receive a

0 KING 'KING CASTLE' 'KINGS CASTLE' 'THE KING CASTLE' 'THE KINGS CASTLE'~
Recommended level range: 25 - 40
 
The castle of Good King Welmar was built ages ago near the city of Thalos. 
Upon the city's destruction, it lay empty for many years, many claiming it 
was cursed along with Thalos. However, when our King Welmar united the five 
great cities and thus created hope in the battle against Darkness, he found 
himself without a keep. Risking death, he and his troups crossed through the 
ruins of Thalos, eventually reaching the magnificent, impregnable fortress. 
The castle now stands as a tribute to honor, good and law.
~

1 'KINGDOM OF JUARGAN'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 25

The mighty dwarven Kingdom of Juargan was once a powerful influence
in the battle against Darkness. Sealed within their impregnable city,
any attack against them was scoffed at. However, one day centuries
ago, the great mountain kingdom sealed its gates and refused to
communicate with any of the other races. The reason for their desertion
is still unknown, but many have found hidden entrances into their vast
underground complex.

1 KONTAUR~
Recommended level range:  25 - 50
 
 
Among the most corrupt of the lands of Despair, is Kontaur, which lies
south of the Old Marsh. Once a lush forest filled with wild vegetation
and beautiful sylvan and elven races, it is now the heart of evil in the
southern lands. The cause of the land's devastation is not completely
known. Sages believe that either Laschte or Vl'arescht opened a gate to
a race of astral travelers known as the Carnifex, which brought legions
of balrogs to Despair long ago. The balrogs waged war against all sentient
races, seeking to destroy at the leisure of their masters. The avatars of
Darkhaven were truly oppressed and fought for their very lives against
this evil army. After years of war, the Carnifex were finally driven across
the Pits of Banishment and into a legendary castle from which they could not
escape. Without their masters' guidance, the balrogs lost their edge and
began losing the war. They retreated to Kontaur, the first realm they had
conquered, and erected a castle. Although there have been many attempts to
destroy the Balrog race, none have succeeded. Many new races have come to
the forests of Kontaur recently, and made the Realms even more perilous.
Foul pixie that were corrupted by Laschte, savage beastmen and, Vl'arescht's
creation, the moblins; allguard the paths to and from the Kontaur castle.
Yet there lies a shining hope in this foul land, for A'enaar lifted her
hand and protected a tribe of forest elves known as the Misinkii. 
 
~

1 'LAND OF THE FIRE NEWTS'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 20

The Land of the Fire Newts lies beneath a portion of Moria known as the
obsidian hills. This strange race is very secretive, attacking all
who intrude upon their home. Due to their reclusiveness, it has never
been known how they came to be or what their true goals are. Also, as they
remain neutral in the battle between Light and Darkness, none have ever
made an attempt to exterminate them.

Languages alone shows which languages you know, and "language learn 
<name>" will add to your percentage of language knowledge.  To learn a 
language, a scholar who is knowledgable in that tongue must be present.

If someone is speaking in a language, and you know it, you will 
understand what they are saying.  However, to change the language in which 
you are speaking, you must change that manually.  (See help on SPEAK).

1 LASOMBRA~
"An excellent decision.  I applaud.  Did you actually manage to reach it all
by yourself?"
 
     Elegant yet predatory, the Lasombra honestly think of themselves as the
apex of Cainite existence.  Firm believers in Divine Right and the rule of
the superior, they have little patience, though often much pity, for those
Cainites who are (through no fault of their own) inferior.
     The Lasombra character is a curious mix of noblesse oblige and healthy
contempt.  They actively seek power wherever is may be found, from the halls
of the cloisters to the corridors of palaces, yet they do not seek the titles
and glory that come along with rule.  Instead of chasing command for its own
sake, Lasombra take the reins of power out of a firm belief that no one can
hold them better.  The appearance of power is unimportant; what matters is
that the decisions are being made by those most suited to make them.  Indeed,
most Lasombra prefer the role of kingmaker to the title of king.
     Hand in hand with this determination to be the final arbiters of all
decisions comes a healthy contempt for those who the Lasombra feel are
inferior to them in mind, body or breeding.  In essence this means the rest
of Cainite society, and while some of the various clans have been accorded a
modicum of respect, there are none the Lasombra will acknowledge as equals.
A Lasombra will work with other Cainites, and even go so far as to consider
members of other clans to be friends, but one will never, ever consider a
member of another clan to be an equal.
     Unfortunately, there are those Lasombra whose delight in the great game
of politics blinds them to all but the game itself.  Master manipulators,
these Cainites view all of the Realms as but a chessboard that they and their
opponents play upon, the fall of kingdoms being only abstract interest to
them.  It is these Lasombra whom the other clans fear most, and their talents
and tastes have been attributed to the clan as a whole.
~

-1 'LAW ASSIST'~
.
&GA non-deadly may give, sell or trade scrolls, potions and equipment
with a deadly character.
 
A non-deadly character may spy for a deadly character.
 
A non-deadly may _not_ shield, heal, summon, help, hinder, portal or
otherwise assist a deadly character (this includes charm).
 
~

-1 'LAW CHANNELS'~
.
&GSpam (repeating the same message repeatedly or otherwise purposely causing
the screen to scroll), harassment (including sexual) and abusive behavior are
not permitted on any channel (this includes in 'say' or 'tell').  Do not
continue to 'tell' to someone after they have asked you to stop.
 
Profanity is not permitted on any public channel, which is a channel seen by
those other than yourself and the person to whom you are speaking.  If you
use profanity in a private conversation and the other party asks you to stop,
please respect their wishes.  The difference between '****, I'm having a bad
day' and 'what is your ****** problem' should be obvious to everyone.
 
If any level of Immortal asks you to desist on a subject, or to move the
subject to an appropriate channel, do so immediately.  Continuing on a
subject or channel after you are requested to stop may result in your
character losing its access to channels through silencing.  An Immortal's
decision on subject matter and/or channel use should be obeyed.
 
&WWarning:  &GArguing with or flaming immortals on channels _will_ get you
silenced or worse, and this may extend to your other characters as well if
you push the matter.  The Realms provides ample avenue for complaint without
resorting to public baiting and name-calling.
 
~

-1 'LAW CHARM'~
.
&GDo not bring aggressive mobs into or near Darkhaven, as when their charm
wears off (either naturally or by attack) their aggressive nature will
return.  Also do not bring aggressive mobs into areas which are lower in
level than the area from which the mob originally came.  You can use the
'areas' command to check an area's level.  See 'help charm' for more.
 
~

-1 'LAW CHEATING'~
.
&GCheating is a very serious offense and subjects _all_ characters involved
to a slay, purge (loss of all equipment), freeze, balzhur (destruction of
all equipment and public demotion to level 2), deny or even a site ban.
 
What is considered cheating?
 - exploiting (intentionally using) a bug to gain equipment or gold
 - intentionally causing the system to crash
 - intentionally duplicating equipment or gold
 - knowingly accepting illegal equipment (see above) from others
 - attempting to duplicate equipment or gold -- * even if not successful *
 - using or making profit from equipment that was accidentally duplicated
 - using gold that was accidentally duplicated
 
Cheating hurts the game, and every player in the game.  Protect yourself
and report any bugs you find, and inform the Immortals if you have strong
cause to believe someone is engaged in any of the above. 
 
If you find you have accidentally duplicated an item, turn the item over
_immediately_ to an Immortal or drop and sacrifice the item.
 
~

-1 'LAW HARASSMENT'~
.
&GHarassment is giving a person unwanted attention, whether you perceive it
as negative or positive attention.  If a person is made to be uncomfortable
by your attention or comments, you are harassing that person.  If a person
asks you to desist in talking to them or performing socials on them, and
you do not stop, you are harassing that person.  If you act in an intimate
manner to a character, without their permission, you are harassing that
person.
 
No form of harassment is tolerated in the Realms.  We especially frown upon
unwanted comments or actions with a sexual nature or explicit content.  If
you do not have an intimate relationship with the person, whether in real
life or within the Realms, you should refrain from using suggestive actions
and/or comments.
 
If you are caught harassing another player in any way, you can be silenced,
helled, frozen, denied, and/or site banned.  Harassing another player is a
serious violation of the rules and will not be permitted.  If you choose
to harass an immortal, you will simply be deleted.
 
~

-1 'LAW KILLSTEAL'~
Don't do it...
 
Kill stealing occurs when a player attacks a mob that is already being
fought.  This is both highly annoying and illegal.  If someone should do
this to you please inform them of the rules (ask them to read 'laws
killsteal').  If they continue, seek an immortal but do not take the law
into your own hands.
 
~

-1 LAW LAWS~
.
&GThe Realms are governed by a set of laws, most of which are simple common
sense and courtesy, and all of which must be followed to ensure everyone
the opportunity to enjoy the game.  As with any mud, a player's presence
here is a priviledge, not a right, and is something we reserve the right
to deny at any time at our discretion.
 
The Immortals of the Realms are responsible for enforcing these laws, and
their decisions these matters should be abided.  If you feel an Immortal
has treated you unfairly, you may petition directly to a level 56 (God)
or higher or you may petition via a note at the Oracle.
 
The decisions of a God or higher are final.  To see which Immortals are
online and visible, type "who 51" at any time.
 
To read the laws, type "laws <topic>" for any of the following:
&W 
       |  CHANNELS      |  PKILL     |  STORES  |  HARASSMENT  |
       |  MULTIPLAYING  |  SHARING   |  STAKE   |  CHARM       |
       |  OBJECTS       |  CHEATING  |  MURDER  |  ASSIST      |
 
&GFor further explanation, see section 2 of the Adventurer's Guide...
~

-1 'LAW MULTIPLAYING'~
.
&GMulti-playing is permitted within the Realms, with the following rules:
 
 - you may only have &Wone&G character link-live if it is a deadly character
   (if it appears under the "who deadly" section of the who list).  You may
   have more than one character online as long as &Wnone&G of your characters
   are listed under the "who deadly" section of the who list.
 
 - using multiple characters to spam any player or channel via making all
   characters say/tell/chat/avtalk a same message or series of messages
   is highly frowned upon and may earn each character a silence.
 
&WNOTE:&G  Link-dead characters are not considered to be "online."
 
~

-1 'LAW MURDER'~
.
&GPlayer killing is decided the instant you cast any hostile spell or make
any aggressive action against a non-deadly player.  Actually killing the
target means little.  The only form of player killing allowed is between
players whose names appear on "who deadly" section of the who list.  A
battle between non-deadly characters is still illegal even if those who
are involved have agreed to the combat.
 
Being involved in an illegal pkill is a serious violation of law, and can
result in a stay in hell, slay, loss of all equipment, freeze and/or deny
or site ban. 
 
~

-1 'LAW OBJECTS'~
.
&GIf you notice an item on the ground and there is a player in the room with
it, do _not_ pick it up without first getting permission from the person<s>
in the room.  Taking such items may be considered stealing if you do not
first obtain permission from those present.
 
Do not simply take an item to identify it without asking permission.  If
you are asked to drop an item you picked up, do so immediately.
 
Do not take items laying next to a corpse, even if no one is present,
without asking the owner of the corpse if the item(s) belong to them.
 
Do not take items from a mob corpse unless you made the kill yourself or
you have specific permission from the character who made the kill.  This
includes removing gold from a corpse.
 
* &WWarning:&G  It is never wise to leave items or containers unattended and
  expect them to be there when you return.  If there is an item on the
  ground and there is neither a corpse nor a player in the room, the
  object is considered abandoned and free for the taking.
 
~

-1 'LAW PKILL'~
.
&GDeadly Characters are those which appear on the who list under the section
titled "Deadly Characters" (type 'who deadly').  A character must be level
5 _and_ 18 years of age to officially become deadly; if you are a pkill
character who doesn't fill these criteria yet, you will not appear under
'who deadly' and are _not_ yet able to pkill.
 
Deadly characters may &Wnot&G:
 a) multi-play while using a deadly character
 b) be shared
 c) receive help (healing, shielding, portaling, etc.) from non-deadlies
 d) receive Immortal corpse retrievals or reimbursements - no exceptions
 e) attack players more than 5 levels outside their own
    - includes picking up disarmed weapons from someone outside your range
    - includes healing a fighting character outside your range
    - includes looting the corpse of someone outside your level range
 
Deadly characters are allowed to:
 a) pkill another player who appears on the deadly
    list (who deadly) who is within 5 levels of their own.
 b) loot the corpse of the fallen deadly player, provided they were
    the tank or delt the killing blow.
 c) use mobs within or lower than the pkill level range of the victim
 
&WWarning&G:  Going AFK or link-dead in a non-safe area leaves you open to
attack; a deadly is open to attack every second online, link-live or not.
 
~

-1 'LAW SHARING'~
.
&GCharacter sharing (when allowed) is always done at the risk of the players
involved.  Immortals will &Wnot&G recover any character lost to trading or
sharing.  Whoever owns the password owns the character.
 
A character may &Wnot&G be shared if:
 - the character is a deadly character
 - the character holds any leadership position in a Guild or Order
 
~

-1 'LAW SPAM'~
No, we are not talking about a luncheon meat here.  Spam is the repeated use
of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen scroll for others.  Not
only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll can interfere with
the game play of anyone seeing it (not to mention combat situations).  The
game will also tell you to PUT A LID ON IT and force-quit you after the 20th
repeat of a single command
 
It is also considered spam to use the same phrase over several different
channels.  The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use

-1 'LAW STAKE'~
.
&GThe first player to attack a mob has the rights to the kill.  Others should
not get involved without being requested to do so.  Those receiving aid are 
under no obligation to reward their benefactors.  Monopolization of a mob and
its repops will not be tolerated.
 
Any disputes brought to the attention of an immortal for resolution will be
handled according the the immortal's discretion.  All such decisions are final.
~

-1 'LAW STORES'~
.
&GShopkeepers inside Darkhaven are protected by the laws of the city's Lord,
Duke Luther.  As the gods have pledged their favor to Darkhaven, they have
imbued these shopkeepers with the powers necessary to carry out retribution
against those who defy these laws.  In short, anyone who chooses to attack
a Darkhaven shopkeeper will die brutally.  In addition, they may find
themselves facing the direct wrath of the gods in hell...
 
Those caught stealing from these shopkeepers will be incarcerated by the
guards of the Duke until such time as their release is granted by the gods.
 
A Darkhaven shopkeeper is any mob inside Darkhaven at which you can type
'list'.  If you are given a list of items for sale, or are told to try
back later, it is a shopkeeper.  This also applies to guild shopkeepers
and the blacksmith.

52 LAYERS~
.
&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:
 
&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.
 
&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values. The lower the
value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is. Valid
numeric values are:
 
&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
 
&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.
 
It is suggested that only those items that will occupy the highest value 
slots, or a slot of 0, have any special affects added to them. Underclothing
should only have a.c. settings.

1 LCK LUCK~
Luck (LCK in your 'score') represents the tendency of a character to succeed
or prosper through chance or good fortune.  As in life, the exact extent of
this factor remains and will always remain shrouded in uncertainty...
 
Also as in life, however, it can be said with surety that its influence on a
character is pervasive.  Though it affects some aspects of life here in a
very direct manner, it can affect nearly every aspect to at least a degree.

underwater.  They are often noted to use underwater caves as their
lair, and are typically found in swamps, marshes, and similar places.
Members of this race band together in rough tribal form; they are
omnivores, and are likely to prefer human flesh to other foods.
Due to this taste for humans, they suffer if their alignment strays
too much towards the honorable side of the spectrum.

This race, of course, has the innate ability to breath under water.

Lizard men gain experience on a scale of normal rate * 0.91
~

65 LOADUP~
Syntax:  loadup <player>
 
LOADUP allows one to load up a player's character (playing or not), to do
whatever needs be done to the character.  (Modifying a flag, changing a
password... etc).  Use FORCE to make the character do your bidding.
 
If we make any changes to the char, we comment the char and place a note in
their inventory explaining who loaded them up and what changes were made.
The character is transed to room 99 and forced to quit there (unless they
are going to be left in hell).  If we don't make any changes to the char, we
trans them back from where they came and force quit them there.  Loadup is
used primarily when a player quits to avoid dealing with immortals or if
they quit before you finish writing a comment.  But it is also used to
investigate chars for duping and other allegations made against them.
 
So... there is actually a wide range of reasons to use loadup and you are
encouraged to use your discretion in this area.
 
If you load up a character to slay or purge them, you must post in 1205.

55 LOG SNOOP~

Syntax: snoop <character>

LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent character toggle.

Certain commands (PASSWORD) are protected against LOG.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

LOG ALL logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots.

SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.
The character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one
character at a time.
The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the players 
name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
-- Do not snoop people being intimate. <i.e. Mudsex, voyeurism, etc...>
-- Do not repeat information learned in snoop casually, especially to mortals
-- Only snoop a person talking to a higher level Immortal with the higher
   Immortals "Express Permission".
-- If a higher level Immortal begins communication with someone you are
     snooping, inform that higher Immortal immediately of the snoop.
-- Any incidental references learned in snoop should be disregarded
    ** For example, you hear someone is having a mud affair, it is not
    ** important to the reason you are snooping.  Do not judge or pass
    ** on information learned in this manner.
-- "Spot check" snooping of lower level Immortals is part of being a higher
   level immortal.  All Immortals may be snooped at any time, for any reason.
-- Do not snoop for the purpose of gaining information for personal reasons.
-- Being an Immortal is a privilege and a job.  Snoop is a tool to assist
   you do your job properly.  Snoop is neither a toy nor a right.

0 MAGICUSER MAGE MAGES~

is a being of pure magic.  Their minds are by far the sharpest, retaining
the knowledge of some of the worlds most powerful spells.  When one begins

power.  They will become a powerful fighting force.  Armed with an
arsenal of various spells, with the main focus in combat spells.  Their
vast repertoire of spells makes them a sought after commodity in the
Realms for their spells can mean victory or defeat for others.  A mage

-1 MENTALSTATE MENTALSTATES 'MENTAL STATE' 'MENTAL STATES'~
.
&gYour mental state is your current frame of mind, and how clearly and
realistically you view your surroundings.  Mental states can be affected
by prolonged combat, hunger, thirst, or poison.  If you are affected by
one of the above for a period of time, your mental state will begin to
deteriorate, and you will not view your surroundings as they truly are.
You may begin to hallucinate, or become too lethargic to function, and
your general abilities will be affected.  In extreme cases you may
collapse from exhaustion or enter a delirious coma.
 
To restore your mental state, you may need to rest (resting and sleeping
will speed your recovery), eat, cure whatever poison afflicts you, etc.
Note that if you are malnourished your state will &wnot&g improve, even with
sleep, until you have fed and/or quenched your thirst.
 
Your mental state is by the text line in 'score' which describes your state
of mind (You feel great, etc.)  The 'group' display contains a less accurate
reading of your and your group-mates' mentalstates as well.
 
Note:  Changing your deity now affects your mental state.

1 MISSILE~
Missile weapons have the unique ability to fire at one's opponent
from a distance.  In order to be successful, the attacker must have a 
weapon missile wielded (Only certain weapons are able to be missile wielded)
and must have an appropriate ammunition in inventory.

Example: To use a bow and arrow, one must have a bow missile wielded and
have an arrow in inventory.
 
See help &Wfire and help &Wfletch
~

53 MISSILES~
Creating a projectile is basically the same as making any other
weapon. The exception to this are its Values (see ITEMVALUES)
and the need to have missiles which match missileweapons.
 
&GFollow this basic proceedure to make a set of projectiles&W:
  1) Create a firing mechanism, for instance, a long bow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'missileweapon'.
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take missile'
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the Value3 (V3) from the table in HELP WEAPONTYPES.
 
&G Now the wielded weapon is done, but you need something to fire...&W
  1) Create a shootable object, for instance, an arrow.
  2) Set the itemtype to 'projectile'
  3) Set the wearflags to 'take'.
  4) Set the projectile values from the HELP ITEMVALUES table.
  5) Set the V3 to match the V3 on the firing mechanism you created.
 
Don't forget to finish the items with weight, cost, long, short etc.
You now have two objects in inventory which are ready to fire.
Lastly, you may create a quiver for certain objects. To do this,
set the itemtype to 'quiver', and use v0 to set its capacity.
Be sure not to set the capacity too high, as quivers should be small.

~

1 'MITHRIL HALL'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50

Mithril Hall's creation is, like many other Realms of Despair, rooted
to Vl'Arescht's whim. Long ago, the Lord of Darkness created a shadow
dragon, which he named Shimmergloom, unleashing havoc upon the races
of Light. The fearsome beast, aided by might shadow hounds and dread
clerics, brought about thirty years of pain and sorrow. It was then
that the legendary Daskyn arose. This heroic man, whose name will be
forever remembered in song, drove back the dragon, tracking it back
to its lair in Garum's Gorge. There, the hero magically sealed
Shimmergloom in it's lair, unable to kill it as Vl'Arescht had blessed it
with eternal life. The dragon's rage was unending however, and it
summoned forth a torrent of servants, sending them to destroy the
peaceful settlements nearby. Our good King Welmar dispatched a legion
of dwarven berserkers to end this shadowy obstacle. With the aid of
the human Cattie-Brie, the dark elf Drizzt Do'Urden, the barbarian
Wulfgar and many others, the keep of Mithril Hall was founded, resting
near the steep cliff face of Garum's Gorge. The battleragers of the keep
maintain a vigilant guard, ensuring that the followers of Shimmergloom
shall never arise from the canyon.

1 'MORGUL VALE'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50

No race has plagued the battle for Light more than the orcs of Morgul
Vale. The orcish population ever-swelling, their incredible numbers
made it impossible to banish them all to their land, as was done with
many other singular beings of Darkness. After a dozen years of war, it
was discovered that an entity of pure darkness named Sauron led the
orcs with the aid of nine minions known as Nazguls. Further research
proved that this entity was very chaotic. A plan was made and executed,
where a party of orcs was led into some clerics of the Dread Lord Seth.
Without hesitation, the orcs slaughtered the dark priests. Lord Seth
took this as a personal offence. His fury was brief but deadly as fire
rained from the sky and Sauron was imprisoned in a strange, tangible
darkness. The orcish population was utterly devastated and the race
no longer has the numbers to wage war. The majority of orcs have
sought refuge in Morgul Vale, and the races of Light have grudgingly
given them ownership of this realm. Many adventurers go hunting there
for sport, yet very few who enter the Vale leave with their body, or
soul, intact.
~

1 MORIA~
Recommended level range: 5 - 15

The vast mountain range of Moria lies to the northeast of Darkhaven,
spanning much of the northern landscape of Despair. Its twisting tunnels

war to conquer this dark realm. These dread mountains also surround the
hated Morgul Vale, providing an excellent defence for what remains of the
orcish race.

If you need to pass through a door, at times they require being unlocked
and opened. To unlock a door, you type UNLOCK <direction or door name>.
To open a door, you type OPEN <direction or door name>.
 
At times, you may run out of movement points or require healing.  To allow
for faster recovery, you may SIT, REST, or SLEEP.  When are finished with

-1 M_BALZHUR_~
Suddenly out of nowhere, a hideous beast appears, bringing with it the
horrible smell of brimstone, death and decay!

The demon gives you the most evil and spine tingling sneer that makes you
fall to your knees, and release your bladder... 

The next second, the immense mass of slimey muscle and claws is all over you
...shredding you to a bloody mess!

Mercifully, everything goes black as it moves its widening maw towards your
head...

-1 M_GODLVL1_~
...Everything begins to fade to black.

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
indeed much more free than you have ever felt before...

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.

powers...

You feel that you have earned some trust and respect among your peers,
yet you know that your jouney has only just begun.

-1 M_GODLVL3_~
...You begin to feel light-headed.

Your hands begin to tingle softly...
The feeling quickly grows into a strange radiating pulse of energy! 

The tingle rises up your arms and into your head, filing your mind with
visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...
 
You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL4_~
...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful! 

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

1 'NATION COUNCILS'~
.  Basically, the Council Positions in a Nation depend greatly on the Leader
and the Nation itself.  There are, however, a few basic positions that each
Nation should have.  Position names can, of course, be altered to suit the
Nation.  Each council should consist of 3-5 people of any level.

Ambassador - The Ambassador is a vital part of any Nation.  S-he is responsible
             for the maintenance of internations relations and any commuication
             between Nations.

WarLord    - The WarLord, also known occasionally as the BattleMaster, is the
             Nation's fiercest and most experienced fighter.  S-he is the one
             responsible for organizing monster runs in which the Nation
             participates.

Second     - The Second is, in effect, the Leader's apprentice.  S-he should
             always be prepared to step into the Leader's shoes in case the
             Leader should meet an untimely demise or have to leave the Nation.

Scout      - The Scout is the one who seeks out possible Nation members and
             recruits them.  The Scout should always be fully aware of the
             Nation's rules, policies and procedures so they may be conveyed
             to the recruit.

1 NATIONS~
Nations has been set up as a venue for role playing throught the Realms.
A visit to the City of Darkhaven will reveal the Realms of Despair is truly
multi-national. It's not unusual to see a troll grunting at a pixie who is
flying over a human, or to see an ogre and orc communing over a mug
of beer. Halfling and Giths may be seen sharing conversations with Dwarves,
Elves and Half-Elves..as long as there is peace in the land. Each race
has its' own government complete with war councils. The government provides
quests and holds Nation summits to discuss international matters. Each
race speaks its' own language on the racetalk channel. 
 
The Nations came into being due to the efforts of the immortal Phalanx, in
April of 1997.

1 'NEW DARKHAVEN'~
Darkhaven, famed City of Hope, lies in the center of Despair's main
continent. The city has never fallen to the forces of Darkness and remains
one of Light's most fervent defenders. In fact, the greatest adventurers
of Despair originate from Darkhaven, certainly profiting from the Academy's
excellent teaching. The Darkhaven markets are always filled with objects
of wonder, and anyone wishing to join one of Despair's nine guilds will
certainly want to visit the City of Hope, for the guild halls are located
there.
~

1 'NEW OFCOL'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 35

The city of New Ofcol has grown so in recent years that it has been
reunited with its cousin, Ofcol. Now known under the common name
of Ofcol, the two cities form to make one of Light's stoutest defenders.
Guided by an ancient golden dragon and the Priestess of Ofcol and led by
Marshall Diana, the city's soldiers are feared by many of the darker races.
The only downside is the city's position. Located far to the northeast of
the Plains of the North, if any of the other cities of Light came under
attack, Ofcol would have great difficulty in sending aid quickly...
~

1 'NEW THALOS~
Recommended level range: 5 - 35

After the bloody destruction of Thalos, all of the citizens who had
survived banded together to create New Thalos. Far to the east of the city
of Darkhaven and north of the Ishtar river, the city stands to this day.
The Great Eastern desert lies to the south and if you are far enough east,
you can hear the tranquil waves of the Sea of Sorrows lapping against the
shore. New Thalos is one of the five great cities that dares to oppose the
forces of Darkness. Several shops attract many tourists from far away.
The Sultan of New Thalos has joined with Darkhaven and other cities in a
wholehearted effort to oppose the forces of Evil.

Syntax: newbieset <character>

NEWBIESET puts the default (i.e. Darkhaven Academy) equipment into the
character's inventory.  Recipient must be level 5 or lower.
~

50 'NEWCLAN APPLICATIONS'~
In all cases new clan applications would be taken the old way:
 
 - you find your three leaders (no shared leaders here)

 - you find at least two additional avatars
   ... need five avatars total start clan (3 leaders, 2 more)

 - your theme is approved by the conclave; approval is defined
   here as little more than a straining process for quality.
   If you have a theme you're willing to build on/around and
   play and it's not something like a clan that fights for the
   glory of Metallica you're probably okay
 
- you find a deity that's willing to help you in upkeeping
   the clan (i.e. be a mediator with other imms, help you get
   changes made, help you keep the theme of your clan going).
   You won't _have_ to have a deity all the time if it just
   really ends up that you can't keep one, but it's necessary
   to get started (though have pondered linking the function
   of certain clan bonuses such as healers, etc. to the clan
   having a deity, but that's a completely different matter)

NOTE:  This isn't to say an imm-created clan or clans may not be
       introduced, but any such clans would have stipulations on
       them and be for specific use, such as any assassin type of
       clan.  This isn't being planned, just covering bases here
~

50 'NEWCLAN EQ2'~
Equipment option 2:  self-created
 
Created via purchase by the clan.  Either gold or glory or both used
to add affects to the items up to a cap.  Items would start off with
no affects, or perhaps a very, very low set of base stats
 - cap would be raised occasionally to allow more power to be added
   if stock item power overtakes it
   NOTE:  There are new areas coming in that are going to have stock
          items better than existing stock items, and some will have
          items that give unusual rewards.  The difficulty will be
          astronomical, but the value is pretty high
 
Affects could also be removed and replaced at the will of the clan
(i.e. adjusting the item for a cost, remove hps and add some dr, etc.)
or even stripped completely by the clan I suppose if it really wanted
to screw everyone up who had their stuff.
 -  changes to affects could either be retroactive or new eq only,
    meaning when you change a bracer every bracer out there would
    receive that change, or that change would only affect new items
    made.  This is something that would be decided at inception.
 
Yes, cost would be high for affects, and we have not decided on a scale
yet.  It's very unlikely that even the existing clans could foot the
bill for a set of eq comparable even to old clan stuff in a short time.
It's meant that it'll be a slower process, though I'm sure someone will
surprise us.  The advantages are a rising cap over time, the control to
adjust stats as you want and can afford, and that the eq will likely
be more powerful when capped than the divinated eq would be.

-1 NEW_DEATH~
...Everything begins to fade to black.  You feel yourself leaving your body.
Rising up into the air, you feel more free than you have ever felt before...
 
However, before your deity comes to collect your soul, you feel a strange
pulling sensation as strange and colorful mists swirl around you...
 
&CA low voice fills your head with words of advice...
"When your character dies, you are reincarnated at the cathedral of Notre
 Dame de Sioux in New Darkhaven; should you one day become a member of a
 clan, guild or order you will be returned to your own altar."
 
"Your corpse, however, is left behind where you were killed, together with
 all of your equipment, so that you can attempt to return to the scene and
 loot your corpse.  Your gold stays with you.  Corpses decay after time,
 and when this happens the objects inside will decay with it."
 
"Once you have chosen a deity and gained sufficient favor, you may be able
 to supplicate to your deity for your corpse.  Type '&Whelp death&C' for more
 information.  This message will appear only on your first two deaths..."

1 NOTE NOTES~
USAGE - 'note (command) [number or text]'
   (command) can be any of the following:
    List, Read, Write, Subject, To, Show, Post, Remove, Take, Date.
   [number or text] can be left blank, be a number, or be words
    depending on what (command) you use.  Usage is explained below.

LIST - Lists the notes you can read. List [number] lists all the notes
 including, and after [number]. You must be at a note board to List.
 example: 'note list'    shows all notes on the board.
          'note list 10' shows notes 10 and later on the board.

READ - Displays the contents of [number]. You must be at a note board to
 Read, and you must specify a [number].
 example: 'note read 5' displays note #5.

WRITE - Puts you in an editor where you can write a note. You must be
 holding a note, and have a quill in your inventory to Write.
 example: 'note write' puts you in the editor. See Help EDITOR.
 
See Also Help Note2
~

1 NOTE2~
SUBJECT - Sets the subject line of a new note to [text]. You must be
 holding a note, and have a quill in your inventory to set the Subject.
 example: 'note subject Hello World!' sets Hello World! as the subject.

TO - Sets the recipient(s) to [text]. ALL means all players. IMMORTAL
 means all immortals. You must be holding a note, and have a quill.
 example: 'note to Harakiem' sets Harakiem as the note's recipient.

SHOW - displays a note you are holding.

REMOVE - erases note [number] from a note board. You must be at a note
 board and be the note's author or an immortal to use Remove.
 example: 'note remove 12' removes note #12, if you're its author.
 
TAKE - similar to 'Remove' but places the note in your inventory, rather

51 NOTELL NOEMOTE NOTITLE SILENCE UNSILENCE~
Syntax: notitle <character>
Syntax: noemote <character>
Syntax: notell  <character>
Syntax: silence <character>
Syntax: unsilence <character>
 
NOTITLE, NOEMOTE, NOTELL, and SILENCE are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from setting their title, emoting, telling, and using
channels, respectively.  Characters who are notelled will also not recieve
those forms of communication.
 
Use UNSILENCE to remove a player's silence.  Simple use notell, noemote or
notitle on the character again to remove each of those restrictions.

54 'NUISANCE STAGES'~
Stages of nuisances are the affects that the victim picks up while in
that stage.  As time progresses and the victim progresses through the
stages, they pick up new problems and the old ones gradually strengthen.
So for example if they are in stage 3 and progress to stage 4.  They
will feel more affects from stage 1,2 and 3 and pick up the affects from
stage 4. Power level is how hard they get hit with the affect. So if in stage
1 the affect was 2% of the time at power level 1 it may be 4% of the time
in power level 2.  And in stage 2 the affect in stage 1 may be 4% of the
time at power level 1 and 8% of the time at power level 2.
So with that being said here are the current stages and their affects:
Stage 1:  The Thirst Stage 
          This makes them become thirsty quicker.  The formula used is the
following: <current stage>*<power level> for how much more is added to your
following: <current stage>*<power level> for how much more is subtracted from
your thirst each time.  With 100 being not thirsty and 0 being dehydrated.
Stage 2:  The Hunger Stage
          The hunger stage works exactly as above except, the formula
subtracts 1 from the current stage becoming: (<current stage>-1)*<power level>
Stage 3:  The Mentalstate Stage
          In this stage each time your mentalstate worsens nuisance exagerates
the amount you worsen by. The formula used to compute how much more it 
adds or subtracts is: .4*(<current stage>-2)*<power level>.
Stage 4:  The Potion Stage
          In this stage you can not stomach as many potions as you normally
could without the nuisance flag.  Normally if your thirst or hunger is above
48 you can't quaf anymore.  Nuisance makes this a much lower number.
The formula used is: (48-(3*<current stage>)+<power level>)
So at power level 10, stage 10 you could only quaf 8 potions on an empty
stomach.
Stage 5:  The Wait Stage
          In this stage commands start taking longer to complete.  A
normal spell for example takes around 8-15 rounds of wait time.  With this
stage more wait time is added with the following formula:
(<current stage> -4 ) + <power level>    So at Stage 6 at power level 5,
each command would have an additionl 7 wait added to it.
Stage 6:  The Offensive Magic Stage
           In this stage you have a chance of targeting yourself with 
offensive spells instead of whatever target is specified.  The formula
for the percentage or the time you do it is the following:
(<current stage>-5)*8 + <power_level>*6  So at first stage 6 with a power
level of 5 you would have a 38% chance to target yourself with offensive
spells.
Stage 7:  The Defensive Magic Stage
          In this stage, if you are fighting someone you have a chance to
target them with any defensive spells you cast.  The formula used is the
following:  (<current stage>-6)*8 + <power_level>*6 
Continued in help 'NUISANCE STAGES2'
~

54 'NUISANCE STAGES2'~
Stage 8:  The Speech Stage
          In this stage you have a chance to scramble your speech and
scramble other peoples speech (IE what you hear from them).  This works
on a percentage with the following formula:
(<current stage>-7)*10*<power level>  So at stage 9 with power level 2
speech is scrambled 40% of the time.
Stage 9:  The Movement Stage
            In this stage you start moving in random directions like a drunk
does.  This is worked out in a percentage as well. Which works of the 
following formula:  (<current stage>-8)*10*<power level>  So in stage 10
with a power level of 4 you would randomly choose an exit 80% of the time.
Stage 10:  The command Stage
           In this stage your commands start failing (Like mentalstate).
This is done on a percentage of the following:
(<current stage>-9)*10*<power level>  So at stage 10, power level 10 the
character becomes utterly useless, as commands will fail 100% of the time.
Soon there will be more options, when they come in the help files you should
see are:  'NUISANCE' 'NUISANCE STAGES' 'NUISANCE OPTIONS'

51 NUISANCE UNNUISANCE~
&WSyntax:
      &cunnuisance  <victim>
      &cnuisance    <victim> [options]
&GUnnuisance will remove the nuisance flag from a player.
Nuisance will add a nuisance flag to the player specified by victim.
&wThis only works on pc's.  The optional parameters are as follows:
  &cmaxtime <#> <minutes/days/hours>&w
         &wThe maxstage of nuisance. Default is 8 days.
  &ctime <#>&w:  The time in days that the nuisance flag will stay on the
         player, once the time is expired the flag will automatically be
         removed. If this option is not used it will default to a permenant
         penalty.
  &cpower <#>&w:  A number from 1 to 10, 10 being the worst for the player.

&WNote the words before the options are not optional and must be used.

&RExamples:  &cnuisance mortal maxtime 5 days time 7 power 5
&GThis would nuisance mortal for 7 days with the maximum stage being
reached in 5 days, at a power level of 5.  Also note you can leave options
out:  &cnuisance mortal maxtime 5 days power 5 &Gfor example would set the
maximum time to reach the final stage at a power level 5 and use the default
value for the time.  Also options can be rearranged n like:
&cnuisance mortal power 5 maxtime 5 days time 7 &Gwould be the same as the
first example.
&GTo see info on nuisance level, power and set time of a player, use &WMSTAT.

~

1 'OCEAN KEEP'~
Recommended level range: 20 - 50

The city of Ocean Keep borders the Ocean of Storms, a sea whose waves
are in perpetual furor and whose skies are always dark. Ruled by the
Lord and Lady Willem, the city is a thriving seaport where justice
and peace rule. However, tales of pirates under the leadership of a
man named Faragut have been running wild, and it seems there is more
to the 'peace' in Ocean Keep than meets the eye.
~

1 OFCOL~
Recommended level range: 1 - 50

The original city of Ofcol has grown so in recent years that it has
been reunited with its cousin, New Ofcol. Now known under the name
of Ofcol, the two cities form to make one of Light's stoutest defenders.
Guided by an ancient golden dragon and the Priestess of Ofcol and led
by Diana, the city's soldiers are feared by many of the darker races. The
only downside is the city's position. Located far to the northeast of the
Plains of the North, if any of the other cities of Light were to come under
attack, Ofcol would have great difficulty in sending aid quickly...
~

1 'OGRE VILLAGE'~
Long ago, before the threats of Shimmergloom, Orcus or Lord Seth, the
barbaric ogres waged war against our ancestors. With their strange
shamans and fearsome strength and size, the ogres were often able
to destroy the smaller villages of Despair. Many years of war passed,
and the ogre population slowly dwindled, until only a handful of them
remained. The savage giants retreated to their sole remaining village and
awaited annihilation. However, pity overcame the avatars of Darkhaven
and they asked the mages of the Tower of High Sorcery to ensure that the
ogres lived in peace and no longer meant a threat to the Light. A maze of
mists was woven about the ogre village, simple to solve for any intelligent
race, yet confusing for ogres. The threat of the ogre race ended long ago and
very few visit, or attack, them.

1 'OLD MARSH'~
Recommended level range: 20 - 35

~

1 'OLD THALOS'~
Recommended level range: 1 - 30

Those who travel back in time to see the Tree of Life often encounter
the very beginnings of Thalos, when it was far more powerful than
Darkhaven and was protected by Gordon the Brave, Defender of the
Light. The sights and wonders to see in this city are always too much
to tell by those who witness it, for it is a constant reminder of what has
been lost.

1 OLYMPUS~
Recommended level range: 10 - 50

At the Moment of Treason, the Lost Gods entered Es'Tilith and were
sentenced to an eternity of imprisonment.  To spite the Lost even
further, the Lord of Darkness forged two cities of the Gods, which he
named Olympus and Hades. Weakened forms of some of the Lost Gods
of Good were imprisoned in Olympus, while a number of the Evil Lost were
sentenced to Hades. Though these impersonations act like Gods, they
cannot even come close to matching the power of their true forms trapped
inside Es'Tilith. It has even been possible for these illusions to be killed
by powerful Avatars.

51 OSET~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>

If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:
 
        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff
        done

The Paladin
___________________________________________________________
"You are the most excellent of men and your lips have been anointed with
grace, since God has blessed you forever.  Gird your sword upon your side,
O mighty one; clothe yourself with splendor and majesty.
 
In your majesty ride forth victoriously in behalf of truth, humility and
righteousness; let your right hand display awesome deeds. 
 
Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king's enemies; let the
nations fall beneath your feet...
 
You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has 
set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy...
 
I will perpetuate your memory through all generations; therefore the
nations will praise you for ever and ever..."
___________________________________________________________
 
Paladins are warrior priests who draw their power from acts of righteousness
and strict adherence to the Code of The Temple of Solomon.  Their strength
in battle, combined with the ability to perform limited miracles is offset
by the difficulty they experience in perfecting their craft, and the penalties
they suffer when they stray from the path of good.

0 'PASS DOOR'~
Syntax: cast 'pass door'

This spell enables the caster to pass through closed doors.
~

0 PASSWORD~
Syntax:  password  <new password>   <new password>
 
PASSWORD changes your character's password.  You repeat the new password only.
If you do not get it correctly it will not work.  This should end the typo
locking you out of your character.
The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged; it is
impossible for any immortal to in any way see, find or retrieve it.  It
is the responsibility of the player to ensure that the password of the
character is kept secure.
 
Passwords can not contain certain characters, or spaces.  We also advise
that you use an alphanumeric password (one containing both numbers and
letters) as they are harder to guess.  We also recommend that you choose
a password that is greater than 6 characters in length.  A good rule of
thumb is if it is in the dictionary, it is probably not a good password.
 
NOTE:  if you decide to trade a character, you do so at your own risk.
Immortals are not responsible for ensuring fair trades.  You may seek an
immortal to oversee a trade, but it is not their  responsibility.
 
&YThe password policy is:  password equals ownership.&w

~

2 PASSWORD_ZMUD~
When you're using zMUD and want to change your password, remember to change
it in the zMUD character settings as well as on the mud.  The MUD's command
for this is:  password <new password> <new password>
In zMUD, click on 'File', then 'Another Character', or 'File', then 'Open'
to access the character settings - and change the password there.
If you have forgotten your character's password but can still log on with
the character, you can still find out what the password is.  Log on with
that character, click on 'View', then 'Preferences' and then click on
General Settings'.  Find the checkbox for 'Gag Password' and make sure the
box is not checked.  Click on 'Ok' to close the dialog box.
Type the command #say %pass [enter].  Your password will be shown on your
screen, but not sent to the mud.  Write it down, for future reference.

The 'Quantum Spike' is one of the Sorceror's most awesome attacks.  With
this spell, the casting Mage is able to form, within the body of his
victim, a sphere of Quantum probability optimized in such a way as to
cause the most bizarre contortion of bodily order imaginable.  Organs
and tissues are rendered into unrecognizable blobs interconnected in
fiendish, unknowable geometries.
 
Obviously, such an attack has astonishing effects on any physical
creature, as well as any entity which has an extention into the
physical world.

0 QUEST~
Syntax: QUEST <message>

The quest channel is one which is typically used when a quest is being 
run, to notify players who are involved as to new updates.
 
Quests are held at the whim of Immortals. If you are using the Quest channel
to ask if there is a quest, you are probably too late to enter. Simply keep
the channel on and wait for an Immortal's announcement, should there be one.
~

52 'QUEST AREA' 'JADE.ARE'~
. The Quest council is gearing up to begin work on the next Quest area.  The
Tourney area was just a small experiment to get warwmed up compared to the
new undertaking.  Imagine a tower trapped between dimensions that randomly
appears in different parts of the realms at differnet times of day.  Well,
it's going to happen, and Yes, it is kind of like that Castle in the movie
Krull, but it'll still be damn cool.
 
&YWhat does this mean to you?&G
  The Vnums in &WJade.are&G will be overwritten.  They are needed for the
impending construction.  There are 15 "reserved" mob vnums and 10 "reserved"
obj vnums that can be signed in/out on a temporary basis.  &WPLEASE&G ensure
that you are following the correct procedure when using the Quest area vnums.
It will prevent people from losing mobs and objs that they need.
 
&YHow to sign in and out vnums&G
  &W*&GDo an mlist/olist and pick a vnum that has the name/short Reserved.
  &W*&GPost a note on 1207, subject VNUM: <mob or obj> <vnum> Signed Out
  &W*&GIn the note, include the vnum you are signing out and the short desc
   of the object/mobile, and &Wthe date until which the vnum is needed&G.
  &W*&GWhen &Wfinished&G with the vnum reset the name/short to Reserved and
   take down the note.
 
 If everyone follows this simple and considerate procedure, construction will
be alot smoother, and there will be less heartache in the end. &WThanks&G

1 QUESTS QUESTING~
.
  Quests are run at random times for different groups of players within the
realms.  They may involve anything from a scavenger hunt, to solving riddles,
to killing mobs that threaten the Realms.  Quests are an excellent way to
meet other players, and enhance roleplaying throught the realm.
  Different quests will result in different awards.  Awards are up to the
discretion of the immortal running the quest.
 
Some things to remember while questing:
 
 &W-&GWe are volunteers, and choose to run quests. If you have criticisms of 
    the quest, or the person running the quest, please be constructive and
    vent your concerns in an appropriate forum - in the Hall of Heroes located
    in the Darkhaven Town Hall.
 
 &W-&GDo not ask when the next quest will be, or if there is a quest. Just pay
    attention to channels and what is going on around you.  If something out
    of the ordinary is going on, there's a good chance it might be a quest.
 
 &W-&GUnless explicitly stated, Multi-playing is &YNOT&G allowed during quests.
    IF you are caught multi-playing, you will forfeit any reward, and most 
    likely have a temporary ban from questing placed on the characters involved

1 QUIT~
Syntax: QUIT
 
QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room, unless that room has a prog that moves
you upon re-entry.
 
QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just
one command.  Nevertheless, it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you
get into the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other
mud that doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.
 
There is no RENT here.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.

The racetalk channel will send your message to all the members of
your race currently online.  This channel can be used to roleplay
in accordance with the characteristics of your race, to plan runs
or grouping with a more focused body of players, or for general
chatter.  Please note that racetalk is partially designed to
promote roleplaying, so attempting to limit yourself to the
characteristics of your race may enhance your enjoyment of the mud,
and may provide a unique experience for those who have never
roleplayed previously.

0 RANGER~
A ranger is the outdoorsman and adventuresome free spirit of the times.  A
self-sufficent person, the ranger is adaptable and can survive in almost
any locale.  Skilled with weapons and able to utilize some of the finest
armor available, a ranger is physically skilled enough to take on most any
foe.  However, for especially hardy opponents, a ranger also can cast many
useful spells to both hinder his opponent and aid himself.  From minor
curative magics to blinding his enemy, the ranger is the most adept class
at surviving on its own.  A ranger typically travels light, but he does
have the mighty strength of a warrior to carry equipment needed in his
travels.  Like the druid (the class other than warrior that he most
closely resembles), his need for help from outside sources is low.

1 RAVEN-TOR RAVEN TOR~
.
Recommended Level Ranges : 25 - 50
 
North and east of Darkhaven lies the Mystic Seaport, where Captain Henry
sails to and from the lands of Duke Argyll Morgan aboard the sailing
vessel, the Sea Witch. Across the Sea of Tranquility, lies the quaint
fishing village of Glen Domaire. Further up the coast, is what is known as
the Wild Coast. Here you can find the Keep of Glen Morgan, ancestral home
of the Clan Dubh Glas, the fabled Westwood, and the Stonewall. The Stonewall
separates the Moors from Glen Morgan and slows the Scourge, which has ravaged
the Dukes' lands for generations. It is rumored that these marauders come from
the tower Dom Caligh atop the Raven Tor, the highest hill of the moorlands.

1 'RB EFF'~
.                          Elite Fighting Force
Or EFF by its shorter designation, is an officially sanctioned Order concept.
Its history can be traced to the original Troll Elite Fighting Force (TEFF).
The TEFF was born in the Ranger Guild under Gelroos' term of Guildmaster, and
led by Duquesne StarProfit, Lost Mountain Troll.  Kadurel and Smurgle were two
of its core members.  Between them, they successfully killed Odin over a dozen
times, Gr'staka 3 times, Artemis countless times, and generally did what top
Avatar said 3 mediocre Rangers could not do alone.
 
The concept is fairly simple, the same Avatars always groups and fights as one
team. The team numbers from as little as 3 to as high as 5.  There are several
teams and new ones being formed all the time.  It is limited to Avatars only,
but exceptions will be made by the Team Leader for those of level 42 and above.
The team practices several times on some of the lower rated mobs first, such as
Artemis, Odin, Horus, Honor, and similiar type mobs.  Then they graduate to do
mobs such as Zeus, Mandor, Nelson, and Thoth.

By working together constantly, the team comes to learn each other's strengths
and weaknesses, and to learn how to successfully kill a big mob without dying
or losing team members.
 
All the teams are under the direction of The Trainer.  This person offers
advice and counsel to the teams as well as sets the mob training schedule.
The Trainer also appoints Team Leaders and approves creation of new teams.
Duquesne is currently the head of EFF, and you should contact him if 
interested in becoming a member of the Order of Ringbearers EFF.
~

1 'RB INDUCTION~
You may post your interest and get a guide book to the Order of Ringbearers
northeast of "a field by the river" in shattered refuge's gnome village.
You will find a small cottage next to a budding reed, this is where you
can find out more about the Order and the induction process.
 
Ah! But you have questions now about the Order, do you not?  Well,
we shall try to answer the most common questions now.  First, you must
be level 30 or higher to apply for membership. After you have you have
completed an interview with one of the Induction Team (IT) members,
you will be given your induction quests.  <By the way, a small hint,
you will be questioned on your knowldedge of the Guide during your
interview, so read it carefully!>  The quests are designed to test your
skills and knowledge of the Realms based on our standards for your level
and equipment. Failing a quest does not mean failure in the true sense,
it is more a postponement as an Order member will show you how to 
complete the quest you failed. Time will be spent helping you gain further
knowledge of the Realms, if you wish.  Then, another quest will be given.
 
Note: Your induction quests generally consist of 2 parts, tho in some
cases a third part will be added.
 
Once you have completed all the requirements, the Induction Team member
will contact a Leader (LOOK JOURNAL in induction room) to induct you.
~

1 'RB MAPPING'~
The Explorer team is an officially sanctioned Order concept.  The Explorer
team is open to all levels of Order members.  The team is responsible for
recording and mapping all areas of the Realms, and sharing that information
with fellow Order members.  We have set aside a Collected Knowledge room
in the Orders Headquarter to place this information.  The walls of this
room will soon be covered with maps and information from every corner of
the Realms.  
 
If you are interested in becoming a member of the Order of Ringbearers
Explorer team, please see Gelroos or a Ringbearer with [Explorer] in their
title.
~

1 'RB' 'RINGBEARERS'~
In ancient times, savage creatures of all different classes, races, and
sexes fought as individuals, with little regard for others.  Soon, these
creatures of the world began to see the wisdom of forming groups for survival.
The first of these groups was the family.  Husband, wife, and children all
worked together to benefit the family.  This method of organization still
lacked sufficient power and opportunity.  After a number of centuries, the
first of the great guilds appeared, offering members a chance to unite based
on their choosen class.  These guilds proved sufficient in providing for the
social needs of their members.  However, guild members were often forced to
look outside of their guild for needed resources...  In trying to fill this
void, several individuals begin grouping together, and began what is now called
the Order of Ringbearers.
 
The primary goal of the Ringbearers' is to grasp the rings of truth, honor,
and knowledge.  This is done through exploring the Realms, teaching and
learning from others, and staying respectful to all others.
 
Equality in all forms is a central ideal of the Order of Ringbearers.  No
one class or race shall receive preference over another.  All segments
must unite in a circle, or a ring of brotherhood, to deliver success.

In the Order of Ringbearers, all members shall have the right to voice
their opinions and vote on Order policy.  No member shall be sanctioned
nor outcast for words they say while in the confines of the Order's
headquarter, or over Ordertalk, as long as they remain respectful and
honest to themselves and their fellow members.

1 'REALM OF WORSHIP'~
Recommended level range: 0 - 60

Very little is commonly known about the Realm of Worship, a series
of dark, lonely tunnels within the mountains of Moria. It was once the
residence of the Terror, the dreaded earthly manifestations of the Gods.
However, it is now empty save for the remaining guardians of Terror. Two
tales concerning this Realm's new purpose are being told lately. One claims
that the Realm now serves as a temple where the most desperate of followers
can come to convene with their God. The other dictates that the most powerful
Terror guardian has made a lair out of the dark tunnels. Whether these tales
are true or not, the Realm of Worship is wandered by only the most powerful
adventurers, and occasionally by those who seek a quick death.

58 REBOOT SHUTDOWN WIZLOCK~
Syntax: reboot <nosave>
Syntax: shutdown <nosave>
Syntax: wizlock

REBOOT shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of sixty seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.

SHUTDOWN shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.

WIZLOCK is a toggle command.  When the server is WIZLOCKed, players
below level 51 may not log in.  Players who lose their links, however,
may reconnect.

If nosave is specified for reboot or shutdown, it will not automatically 
save all of the players.
~

1 RECALL~
With a scroll or potion of 'word of recall' you can instantly return from
most areas to your attuned recall spot (Thoth's Rune in Darkhaven for any
those who are not deadly, clanned or a member of an Order or Guild).
 
Scrolls of recall are available in Darkhaven's section of magic shoppes.

~

0 'RECHARGE'~
Syntax: cast 'recharge' <wand/staff>

This spell is used to recharge wands and staves after use.  The mage
or cleric performing the recharge should always insure the item is
not fully charged, as overcharging is considered dangerous.  Also,
there is always a small chance of destroying the staff, or in even 
rarer instances multiplying the charges available.
~

0 REDFERNE 'REDFERNE RESIDENCE' 'REDFERNES RESIDENCE'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 47
 
After many aeons of seeming emptiness, the cloaking illusion of the fell
Sorceress Naris has been lifted from the building known unto men as Redferne's
Residence, or alternatively, The Stronghold of Naris. 
 
Redferne was a loyal knight paladin, true in both sword and honor.  Betrothed
in marriage to the lovely Naris of Thalos at a young age, they built a 
grand fortress and their lands prospered.  Naris, alas, dabbled in sorcery,
and as the years progressed, her soul was overtaken by the evils below.
 
When the fiend liches came to claim her body and soul, a mighty battle ensued,
in which Redferne himself is known to have lost his life.  Less is known of
Naris' fate.
 
The illusion of emptiness was in some manner related to the strange location
the fortress formerly held, floating in the firmament of Darkhaven.  When the
spell was broken, the fortress returned to its location of old, behind great
dark gates in a quiet corner of what is now refered to as the 'Old Marsh.'

exname | <direction> [keywords] -- sets an exit's keywords
exkey  | <direction> <key vnum> -- sets an exit's key vnum/value
 
Note: Put a '+' before the direction to force ADDing of that exit
      and use a '#' to specify the exit by sequential order.
 
REDIT ON will lock you into a mode in which 'redit' is implied in each command
sequence, and hitting enter will give you an instant rstat of whichever room
you are in at the time. To get out of REDIT ON, simply type the word DONE. 
Example:
 
        redit on
        name A dark and forboding hallway
        flags dark indoors
        done

1 'REIMB' 'REIMBURSEMENT'~
Deadly characters are never eligible for Reimbursements.
Experience can _not_ be reimbursed under any circumstances whatsoever.

The following are causes we will NOT reimburse for:
-- Loss of corpse due to corpse decay.  See "help corpse" for details.
-- Loss of corpse due to lag.
-- Loss of corpse due to problems with your system or the net.
-- Individual items lost due not saving your character regularly.
-- Individual items lost due to carrying items above your level.
-- Individual items lost because they were zapped or dropped on the ground.
-- Containers lost because they were left on ground or destroyed by a mob.
-- Weapon loss due to disarm before crash, reboot, or from a mob taking it.
-- Items lost due to hitting a death trap
-- Items lost due to scrapping by mobs or other players
-- Items lost due transferring equipment from one character to another.
-- Items lost due to not saving after looting your corpse and a crash occurs.
 
Corpses are now saved across crashes and reboots, eliminating the need
for most reimbursements due to corpse loss.  The ONLY cause for reimbursement
is when a corpse reappears in the game empty after a crash or reboot.

To apply for a reimbursement post a note on the Oracle Board setting out the
circumstances of the loss and the five items you had prior to loss that you
would like reimbursed.  We will not reimburse certain items, such as gold,
potions, glory, clan items, or more than one weapon.  We will only consider
reimbursement requests made within one hour of a reboot or crash.  Only a
Demi God or higher may do a reimbursement, but any level Immortal may deny
one.  We will attempt to deal with the request as expeditiously as possible.
~

1 REKEY~
Rekey changes the keyword of an item.
It differs from rename in that it is not the name that is seen, but the
name the object is identified as and can be looked at or picked up as.
For example, if a sword of legend was rekeyed to blade , get sword would
no longer work with this item. (get blade would pick up the item)

   When an item is rekeyed, one of the words from the short description
     &GMUST&W be used in the rekey.
 
Rekey is included in the rename fee. See help glory for more information.
~

1 REMAINS~
Syntax:  remains
 
A worshipper may request knowledge on the disposition of their remains
from his or her deity (meaning the location and remaining time before
complete decay).  However, the imposition comes at the cost of a small
amount of favor -- approximately twice that of the character's level.
 
If no remains exist, there is no penalty to favor.
 
SEE ALSO:  supplicate
~

0 'REMOVE CURSE'~
Syntax: cast 'remove curse' <character>

This spell removes a curse from a character, or one of the objects a
character is carrying or using.
~

0 'REMOVE TRAP'~
Syntax: cast 'remove trap' <object>

This spell will magically disarm a trap on an object.
~

1 RENAME~
A rename may be done by a level 54 or higher immortal.  If you wish
for the rekey to be completed at the same time, you must contact a
level 56 or higher immortal.  The rename can be purchased with 20
glory or a rename scroll.  Wedding renames are done with a marriage
license by Blorin, the Darkhaven engraver.  (See help wedding)
Renames are to be medieval in style for mortals and must not contain
the name of an immortal without their expressed consent.  Items will
not be renamed to machine gun, silly putty, etc.
Before contacting an immortal to redeem glory or scrolls for a rename,
please have in mind what you would like done.  You will need to consider
the following:
Short description - what is seen when the item is worn by a person.
Long description - what is seen when the item is lying on the ground.
Rekey - the renaming of the item (usually something from the short desc)

1 RENT~
Syntax: RENT ... characters never have to rent!
 
There is no RENT here.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave
the game.
~

54 RENUMBER~
&YSyntax: renumber <area filename> <new vnum base> [flags]
Flags: fillgaps verbose
&pExample: renumber haon.are 6100 fillgaps verbose&w

The renumber command renumbers an entire area to a new vnum base. All rooms,
objects and mobs will be renumbered, and all references to them will be fixed 
(changed to reflect the new vnum for each object/mob/room). These references 
include: resets, exits, shops, repair shops, and the objvals of some objects 
(containers and levers). 

Unless the "&pfillgaps&w" flag is supplied, the command doesn't fill vnum gaps. 
If you just want to fill the gaps in the area instead of changing the vnum 
base, simply supply the same vnum base (duh!). 

If the "&pverbose&w" flag is not supplied the command will simply report 
the actions. If it's supplied, it will also list all the vnum changes, and
report details on all the reference fixes.

The command will only modify references inside the area, except for two-way
exits leading into the area, wich will be listed if the "&wverbose&p" flag is
supplied (so that you know that you also have to save those areas). 

Mobprogs can also contain references to vnums, but since prog parsing is
far beyond this command, all it does is perform simple string searches and 
warn you if it finds any (possible) references, and it only does this if
the "verbose" flag is supplied. This search is performed only in the progs
inside this area, not in every mudprog in the game.

In conclusion, &Gall references are modified by the command except&w:
	&p* &Gresets in other areas for things being renumbered
	&p* &Greferences to these vnums in mobprogs in other areas
	&p* &Gone-way entrances to the area

A prototype area can only be moved inside its vnum range, never out of it.
The vnum ranges for proto areas are not touched; the ones for normal areas
are changed to reflect the renumbering. Proto builders can only move their
own area.

Finaly, please bare in mind that there's no way to change hard-coded

have already received. If no parameters are given
it will simply produce the last tell you received.
If a single letter is given, then the last tell
sent to you by a character with a name starting
with that letter will be displayed. This is an imm
only command.
~

1 REPOP~
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present.  Also

WEATHER shows the current game weather.  You must be in an outside room
to see the weather.
~

51 RESERVE~
.
The "Reserve" command enables us to specify certain names that are
reserved and cannot be used by players.
 
We can specify names that we want to reserve because they belong to
former imms (like Narn and Dominus). We can specify names that are
often tried and are a bit of a pain (like Killer or Satan or Seth).
 
We can specify parts of names by preceding the string with an "*">
e.g.  reserve *goof
This will prevent any name with the substring "goof" ... like ...
"goofface", "biggoof" or "biggoofface".
All deity names should be reserved.
 
reserve                        list current reserved names
reserve joe                    add joe to the list if he's not on it
reserve joe                    remove joe to the list if he is on it
reserve *goof                  add the substring "goof" to the list

planned in advance or done on request.  The best way to ensure that a
restore all will NOT be done is to ask for one.

1 RUINS UMBRAGEOUS~
Recommended level range: 5 - 50 (pkill)

After the last Clan Wars, the gods looked down upon the ruins of old
Darkhaven and shifted them into another plane, one that can only be
reached by those who follow a dark and shadowy path. Now decayed beyond
recognition, the shambled remnants of once great structures cover all
signs that this was once the prosperous center of Despair. Burning lava
flows through the city and moving shadows hide killers in their shroud
of darkness. It is said that those who venture through the ruins, and
lived to tell about it, that there are secret portals and passages hidden
within that will lead to the main plane of Despair. It is also rumored
that the spirit of Gravoc oversees the ruins, enforcing his own brand
of death and destruction.

0 I3~
Syntax: i3 <option>

Note: You must meet the mud's minimum level requirement before accessing I3.
You will be notified when you have reached the approptiate level.

General Usage:
------------------------------------------------

List channels available                : i3 chanlist [all] [filter]
To tune into a channel                 : i3 listen <localchannel>
To see who is listening on another mud : i3 chanwho <channel> <mud>
List muds connected to I3              : i3 mudlist [filter]
Information on antoher mud             : i3 mudinfo <mud>
Ignore someone who annoys you          : i3 ignore <person@mud>
Make yourself invisible to I3          : i3 invis

i3 chanlist: Lists the channels the mud has available to listen to.
  Specifying 'all' will list the channels for the entire network.

i3 listen  : Tunes you in to the specified channel. You must meet or
  exceed whatever the minimum level is for that channel to do so,
  and your mud must have the channel configured locally.

i3 chanwho : Shows you who is listening to the specified channel on the
  specified mud. Invisble players will not be shown.

i3 mudlist : Lists the muds which are connected to the network.
  Specifying a filter will narrow the list down to only those muds
  whose information matches. IE: &Wi3 mudlist smaug&D will list all
  muds who have &Wsmaug&D as part of their listing.

i3 mudinfo : Lists the information provided by the specified mud.

i3 ignore  : Allows you to selectively ignore all contact with person@mud.
  This will block tells, beeps, locates, fingers, emotes, and whos. It will also
  block channel output from them, but will NOT block them from seeing YOU on
  a channel.

i3 invis   : Makes you invisible to I3. Performs similar to the ignore option
  except it prevents EVERYONE on the network from finding you. You will still
  be able to use channels, and you will NOT be invisible to others if you
  do so.

See also: i3tell, i3finger, i3emote, i3locate, i3who
~

0 I3BEEP~
Syntax: i3beep <person@mud>

i3beep sends a quick message to a person on another mud.
If the target mud supports the beep tone, then the person
on that mud will hear the standard beep tone used by whatever
client software they are using. Works in the same manner as
the local beep command.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3EMOTE~
Syntax i3emote <person@mud> <message>

Sends a private emote to a person on another mud.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3FINGER~
Syntax i3finger <person@mud>

Request for information regarding a player on another mud.
Operates in a similar manner to the local 'finger' command.
Will only reveal information the target mud feels is appropriate.

When used with the bridge, typing i3finger <mud@i3> will produce a who
listing of the target mud.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3LOCATE~
Syntax i3locate <name>

Asks all the muds on the Intermud-3 network if a person
known by the name is there. Be patient when using this command,
there are a lot of muds on the network to search through, so
a response may take some time to come back.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3TELL I3REPLY~
Syntax: i3tell <person@mud> <message>
Syntax: i3reply <message>

i3tell sends a private message to a person on another mud.

To send a tell to someone on a mud with a multi-word name, you need to
enlcose person@mud in quotes, like so: i3tell 'person@mud with long name'
Otherwise this command operates in much the same way as the local tell command.

To reply to the last i3tell you received, simply type 'i3reply'
followed by your message and it will be sent back to the last
person on I3 who sent a tell to you. Works in the same manner
as the local reply command.

See also: I3, INTERMUD3
~

0 I3WHO~
Syntax i3who <mud>

0 INTERMUD3~
Intermud-3 is a protocol which allows you to chat with people on
other muds who are also connected to Intermud-3. It is primarily
populated by LP based muds at this time, but the hope is to get
more Diku based muds to join over time. While some may say that
Diku based muds would be better served on the IMC Network, it
is far easier for a mud to obtain a connection to the Intermud-3
network, and the commands to use it are generally simpler.
In either case, should a mud desire it, Intermud-3 will coexist
peacefully with an IMC enabled mud. Currently there is no way
for public or private traffic to be passed from one network to
the other.

1 SAVE~
Syntax:  Save
 
SAVE saves your character and its inventory; you must be at least second
level to save.  The system automatically saves approximately one character
every minute, but with the high number of players usually online it may take
hours before your own is auto-saved.  For this reason, you should not
rely on auto-save to keep your character updated -- save frequently.
 
Type SAVE immediately after recovering your corpse, gaining experience or
a level in battle, getting new items, making purchases or repairs, etc.
 
Some objects (such as keys) may not be saved.  You cannot SAVE and QUIT
with objects of a higher level than your own, as they will vanish when
you log out.  Every character is auto-saved at reboot.

1 SAVE POSITIONS~
At current time, there are 14 "positions" in the game. Positions
are in a special order.  If position b is below position a on the
list, that indicates that while in position b, you have more 
physical or mental energy to spend on a task, be it a command,
a spell, or a skill.
 
For example, while standing, you have a greater ability to do things
than while sitting.  While fighting evasively, you have more options
than while fighting aggressively.
 
The ordered list is as follows, left to right, top to bottom:
Dead          Mortally Wounded        Incapacitated
Stunned       Sleeping                Fighting (Berserk)
Resting       Fighting (Aggressive)   Sitting

survivor sought revenge against the Gith.  She devoted herself to the
practices of Infernalism in an attempt to uncover the puzzle of Time, hoping
to travel to the past and rescue her village.  As her studies progressed.
she became unable to control her thoughts and actions.  She came to
realize how to travel through time, yet her evil mannerisms aroused the
anger of Father Time.  The ancient lord banished her from travelling in
time forever because of her demonic powers.  Unable to complete her
quest, the demoness Malsangre now wanders the Astral Plane, slaying the
Gith and sending willing travellers back in time against her new foe,
Time itself.  In fear of her threats, the Father has generated a massive
defense to protect the sanctity of his realm.

to do so.

57 SETBOOT~
Syntax: setboot time <hour> <minute>
 	setboot manual <0|1>

The setboot command is useful for planning a reboot, (to save you from 
the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

the sewers. They delve deep underground, allowing great flows of rain

Recommended level range: 10 - 50

Easily one of the darkest, deadliest cities of Despair, Shadowport is
an ancient subterranean town populated by the beings of Darkness. Its
entrance lies deep below the ground, in the darkest reaches of Darkhaven's
sewers. Rumors say that there are many other entrances, but none have 
been confirmed. The city itself is ruled by Lord Xyranthas. Once recognized
as the greatest magi of his time, Xyranthas was turned to darkness with the
promise of immortality and unlimited knowledge. Upon his transformation to a
lich, he created the hideous shadowmists and formed Shadowport from rock with
incredible magics. Many an adventurer has fought his final battle here, and
there shall surely be numerous others...
~

1 'SHATTERED REFUGE'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 20

The shattered remains of the ancient civilization of tinker gnomes resides
here, to the southeast of eastern Darkhaven and in the shadow of a fiercesome
mountain range. Inhabitating the tunnels beneath the mountains are the
gnome's perpetual enemies, and one time students: the hobgoblins. Similar to
goblins in many ways, they lack the intelligence and inventiveness of the 
gnomes. This is made up however in good measure with cunning and wicked ways.
This filthy chaotic race has made it their goal to rule the gnomes, and 
eventually all of Despair itself.

.                          The SMAUG FUSS Project
                             www.smaugfuss.org

FUSS stands for: [F]ixed [U]p [S]maug [S]ource
It has also come to be known by the alias: [F]ixed [U]p [S]tock [S]ource

The ongoing goal of this project is to find and eliminate as many of the
bugs in the stock SMAUG source code as possible so as to provide for a
clean, stable base for new admins to run a SMAUG mud from.

The project is coordinated by Samson, lead developer of the AFKMud codebase.
Contributions are made by various members of the SMAUG community.

Most of the fixes are culled from forum posts, emails to the SMAUG mailing
list, and from continuing work on other SMAUG derivative projects in which
bugs are found that apply backward to the base distribution.

1 'SOLAR FLIGHT'~
Syntax:  c 'solar flight' <victim>
 
This spell allows the caster to merge from an outdoor area to their victim
in an outdoor area.
 
The spell has a few restrictions:  you will only succeed in casting it
during daytime hours, between 7 A.M. and 5 P.M. and you will only succeed
in casting if both you and your victim are in an outdoor area -- you need
the power of the sun in order for this spell to work (thus it will also
not succeed in bad weather).
~

1 'SOLOMONIC INVOCATION'~
Syntax:  c 'solomonic invocation'
 
The Paladin prayer by which their holy symbol is created.
 
~

1 'SONIC RESONANCE'~
The magick of 'Sonic Resonance' allows the casting Mage to realign
the component particles of his foe in such a way that they are
susceptible to a certain mystical tone.  By the completion of the
spell, this tone is conjured, causing the particles to vibrate 
violently causing intense pain and tissue damage.
~

1 SPAM~
No, we are not talking about a luncheon meat here.  Spam is the repeated use
of a phrase, command, or channel that causes screen scroll for others.  Not
only is spam considered rude, but excessive screen scroll can interfere with
the game play of anyone seeing it (not to mention combat situations).  The
game will also tell you to PUT A LID ON IT and force-quit you after the 20th
repeat of a single command
 
It is also considered spam to use the same phrase over several different
channels.  The use of all-caps can also be considered spam.  Only use
capitals to add emphasis to key words in a sentence.
 
Moving a large number of items into and out of a container in a crowded, 
non-store room is considered spam.  Using multiple characters to chat the
same message at the same time is considered spam.  Making charmed mobs
or pets to cause screen scroll through movement or orders is considered
spam. ANYTHING that causes excessive or irritating screen scroll can be
considered spam.
~

1 SPEAK LANGUAGE~
Syntax:  speak
Syntax:  speak <language>
Syntax:  speak all (immortals only)
 
The speak command changes the current language in which you are speaking.
To speak your native tongue, type 'speak' alone.  To speak a specific
language (such as common, for example), type "speak common".
 
Immortals have the unique ability to speak so that everyone can understand,
by typing "speak all".

spec_breath_any          Mobiles breathes one of the four breaths randomly.
spec_breath_acid         Mobile has breath of acid.
spec_breath_fire         Mobile has breath of fire.
spec_breath_frost        Mobile has breath of frost
spec_breath_gas          Mobile has gas breath.

1 'SPECTRAL FUROR' 'HAND OF CHAOS'~
After the Dark Mage Thanatos accidentally discovered the spell
'Disruption' in a failed attempt to create a teleportation magic,
he spent many years studying how to increase the pain that can
be inflicted by incorrectly moving a victim across the threshold
of dimensions.  
 
 'Spectral Furor' is a formula which, by upsetting the very nature
of the space the victim inhabits causes neural as well as brute
physical damage.
 
With 'Hand of Chaos,' Thanatos perfected this line of magic, and he
returned to his researches on the art of astral travel.
~

1 'SPECTRAL GATE'~
Recommended level range: 1-2

It is a well known fact that when a God creates a mortal, the being
enters the multiverse through the Spectral Gate. The strange journey
through this portal sobers the mortal and determines his demeanor
and nature. All know as well that once you enter the multiverse, you
may never return through the Spectral Gate.

1 STORY2~
. And so the multiverse was destroyed. Comforting Oblivion now reigned
over all. This peace did not last long however, as a powerful backlash
arose from Dominus' magic wielding, a strange entity containing the very
essence of magic. It quickly weaved a new plane and world. A monument to
life was grown, which it called the Tree of Life. From the Tree sprung
creatures of all types, just as they were before Dominus wielded Oblivion
against them. New lands were created and these slowly spread outward from
the Tree. Cities were founded and conquered, and life began anew. The Tree 
also blessed some beings with knowledge of the Old Ways. These few mortals
learned about the Lost Gods and took to worshipping them.
  Dominus eventually discovered this seed of Life within the vast void and,
with a mere thought, destroyed it. As he was about to eradicate the remains of
the unnamed plane, Thoric halted his hand, deeming that none would interfere
with this interesting offspring of magic. Dominus was given the eternal task of
overseeing this plane, which Thoric named Despair.
  Despair began as a world of Goodness, yet has now been corrupted over the
ages by Dominus and the Gods he raised through divine ascension. The peaceful
mortals of this now dark plane find themselves pressed into war against the
Darkness. Beings of Light have become increasingly rare and a single, great
resistance has binded together: the towns of Solace, Ofcol, New Thalos,
Ocean Keep and most importantly, Darkhaven. All the other Realms of Despair
have fallen, and thus does Good's hope falter and wither...
~

1 STR STRENGTH~
Strength (STR in your 'score') represents your character's physical power.
 
The most common concern with strength deals with how much your character
can carry.  For each additional point of strength  you gain an additional
amount of maximum carryable weight.  Any character with 20 strength can
carry 500kgs; Warriors and Rangers can have a maximum of 25 strength, and
can therefore carry up to 999kgs when their strength is at its maximum.
 
Strength also affects (among other things):
 
 - damage roll and hitroll; for each additional point of strength, each
   of these will increase
 
 - chances of success for bash, stun, bashdoor, shove and drag, and the
   ability to dual-wield heavier weapons
 
Strength is the prime attribute of warriors, rangers and paladins.
 
~

0 STUN~
Syntax: stun <mob>

~

1 STYLE STYLES~
Usage: style <style name>
 
Styles, when effectively used, can change the tide of battle. The more
experienced one is in a particular style, the better the chances that it
will work for the fighter's advantage. There are five different known
styles. Styles can be changed within combat to better ones advantage
and knowledge of each of the different forms of combat.

1 'SULFUROUS SPRAY'~
With the incantation 'Sulfurous Spray,' the casting mage culls from
the air the elements necessary to form a strong acid which rains
down upon his opponent or opponents.  This strength and velocity
of the spray is such that it can work its way into various forms
of armor and clothing, and it is also able to harm opponents one
might think resistant to such attacks, due to its magical nature.

1 THALOS~
Recommended level range: 10 - 25

 
Thalos was once the most powerful nation in Despair, a constant thorn
in the side of Darkness, an ever-vigilant defender of Light. It was not
surprising then that, after another victory against Lord Seth's forces,
a magical black mist was unleashed on the city. Any who entered the foul
mist were dead within minutes, poisoned by the deadly vapors. When the
dark cloud lifted, Thalos was left in ruins, its once slavebound lamias
now deadly creatures. A beholder was left to rule over the wreckage.
None have attempted to rebuild Thalos, for they say it is cursed for
all time...
~

1 'THE ASTRAL PLANE'~
Recommended level range: 15 - 35

High above Darkhaven, perched atop a heavenly rainbow, is the ever-
standing pearly gate to the Astral Plane. Once a gateway between worlds
and planes, it is now a black void which is connected to but one world.
The Astral Plane's inhabitants do provide much intrigue however, even if
their homeland does not. The githyanki, as they are called, were once humans
enslaved by the mind flayers of Shadowport. Led by the Lady Gith, they
escaped, yet their minds and bodies were so tortured that they were no
longer accepted openly among humans. Using new psionic powers, they quickly
dominated the Astral Plane. Since then, a powerful lich has become the
ruler of the race. None know the fate of the Lady Gith, although many
speculate that she lost or refused to fulfill a bargain she made with dark
powers to free her race...
~

1 'THE KEEP OF MAHN-TOR'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 35

The city of minotaurs, Mahn-Tor, lies on the continent of Antarctica, across
the lapping red waves of the Blood Sea. Most adventurers reach this land
through the ancient Blood Sea Portal. Named after its ruler, Mahn-Tor was
founded long ago after a dark, unknown sect created the minotaur race by
joining the features of bulls with unwilling humans. This savage race
eventually rebelled and won its freedom. In recent years, the minotaur race
has become much more civilized and though tempted to joing the forces of
Light, they remain in neutral in the war between Good and Evil.
~

1 'THE SHIRE'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 35

The Shire is a small village of halflings and hobbits to the northwest
of Darkhaven.  The town is run by the Thain, who also manages the trade
of wheat with other towns.  Very little danger exists in the Shire,
save for the occasional thieving youth, or angry bull.
~

1 'THE TOWER OF ZENOTHIR'~
Recommended level range: 15 - 25

In the dwarven forest to the southeast of Darkhaven is a small village
and tall tower. Residing in the tower is, of course, Zenothir, a famed
magician who made his fortune with the magical art of illusion and 
trickery. Other practitioners of this art have flocked to this tower and
founded a small village around it, although some say it is more a circus
than village. Although it is a well known fact that Zenothir has taken up the
cause of Good, these followers firmly believe that those who impress the
great mage sufficiently will be rewarded with his infinite knowledge of 
illusionary magic.
~

1 'THE TREE OF LIFE'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50

It was this Tree that the essence of magic weaved ages ago, after the
planes of the multiverse were destroyed by Dominus. From the Tree of
Life grew the beginnings of existence on Despair, from the lowliest
insect to the wisest of sages. Many have visited the Tree even after
its destruction by travelling through a magical portal which links
the present and the past. Those who return speak of many powerful
entities which combine many elements of life.
~

1 'THE UNDERWORLD'~
Recommended level range: 0 - 60

Far beneath the surface of the earth, beneath even the dwellings of the
dwarves, is the Underworld. Located near the center of the world of Despair,
it a realm of fire, brimstone and ash. Flows of lava are common and the 
heat of this dread place has been known to kill the weak of heart. Hideous
beings populate the Underworld, led by Satan. None know where she arose from,
though many speculate that she is a powerful entity with dominace over death.
~

0 THIEF THIEVES~
The thief is a dark character which makes use of many skills often deemed
improper by the rest of society. Known to haunt the darkest roads and
alleys. The skills of the thief reflect his way of life, be it sneaking,
peeking into others' inventories, picking locks, or attacking from behind
with deadly backstabs. With amazing dexterity they have the ability to
circle around an enemy, but for living such a dark life, thieves have
always had a bad reputation so don't be suprised if you are always under
suspicion. Thieves start off fairly weak, but as they gain skills such as
backstab and circle they soon become dangerous foes.  A thief is always
useful when there is  a lock that needs pryed, or an item that one wishes
to acquire without detection.

0 TICK~
Many of the actions in the Realms are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.
 
Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in these Realms average 60 seconds of real time, but the
actual amount varies randomly from 45 seconds to 75 seconds.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present; Also,
some lower level areas have shorter reset periods, while some higher level
areas have longer reset periods.
 
Note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone is
in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' or other messages just prior
to the reset itself.

15 to 22                "fills the air with a foul stench."
07 to 14                "is crawling with vermin."
01 to 06                "is in the last stages of decay."
 
Since a corpse now lasts from 40 to 60 minutes, we are requested to wait
until the corpse has reached below a timer of 23 or has hit the
"fills the air with a foul stench." stage in decay.
 
You can see what stage of decay a corpse is in by either typing:
ostat <player name>       (i.e. ostat Brittany)    OR
at 'corpse <name>' look   (i.e. at 'corpse Brittany' look)

1 TOURNEY~
Recommended level ranges : 30 - 50
 
Forged through time and perilous blood and sweat, this gladiator arena is
famed for its prizes given to those proven victorious in the tournament.
Survival and fame, there is no second place within the halls of this
colliseum.  Guarded by once gladiators themselves, you will find that any and
all fighting is kept within the center of the arena.  Night after night,
thousands of spectators come from far and wide to witness the chilling spill
of blood and hopes.  You will find that within this massive and luxurious
colliseum there is no such meaning for the word mercy.
~

0 TOWER 'TOWER OF DESPAIR' 'THE TOWER OF DESPAIR'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50
 
The dark Tower of Despair has existed for many ages as a black spike 
that corrupts the landscape west of Darkhaven. The God Strahd created 
this monstrosity, a gift to his most loyal servant: Orcus, Demon Prince 
of Death. The early ages of Despair were plagued by his dreaded minions 
and the undead walked the land. Orcus was without a doubt the most powerful 
evil in the Realms until he crossed the legendary Zarkas. Wielding the lost 
blade Nemesis, the Ancient Vampire Lord forced Orcus back to his abode and 
sealed the Lord of Undeath in his tower. Though Orcus is forever imprisoned, 
he still influences Despair to this day. Rumors, recently confirmed, tell 
that he has even managed to capture a solar, a being of pure Light.
~

1 'TOWER OF ENLIGHTENMENT'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50

The Tower of Enlightenment is situated near Lord Seth's Fortress, a
beautiful sight compared to the Dread Demigod's castle. Little is known
about this monument to knowledge, although many speculate that a tour 
of the tower can bless an adventurer with a crude understanding of the
multiverse. Some even say that the Infidel, Circe, has crafted under-powered
forms of some of the Lost Gods and sentenced them here to give adventurers
a feeling of godly might.
~

1 'TOWN HALL'~
Recommended level ranges: 0 - 60
Darkhaven's latest architectural feat was in a sense, a prank at first.
The diety Elcid, looked upon the old Town Hall, and decided unto himself
that is was too easily accessible. So it was with his keen mind that he
created the New Town Hall. At first it was a maze of tricks and traps,
mostly harmless fun until Brontrel looked down upon this and instilled
Order unto the Hall. Now it is a place where all may meet and talk of
that which interests them. Many boards covering all subjects lie scattered
thought the three floors of the hall, along with meeting rooms where such
 
councils may be convened. Upon the first floor, the Mayor and the Judge of
Darkhaven reside, and the top floor was taken over by the Symposium to
better relations between mortals and immortals alike
~

1 'TOWN OF SOLACE'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 50

The town of Solace lies to the northwest of Darkhaven, attainable through
a path in Haon Dor. It is one of the five cities of Light and has fiercely
defended its territory for ages with the aid of the famed Mandor and Nelson.
An interesting quirk of Solace's citizens is that they do not believe in the
use of magic or the aid of the Gods. They are the meaning of the word warrior.
All are advised to keep this in mind when challenging the city's finest.

1 TRANSYLVANIA~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50
 
Transylvania was once a populated isle floating in the vast Sea of
Sorrows. Its people were strong and hard-working, ruled by an honorable
Prince. Its fate was decided when the ancient Inconnu elder, Dracula,
was overcome by a malevolent entity and abandoned his clan. It 
is thus that he came the Transylvania. The land's people slowly began
disappearing, replaced with vampiric minions and leeches. In the end,
the Transylvanian Prince fled, leaving the living that remained to die,
and then live in undeath. A small number of individuals still fight
the darkness in this hopeless land. The Count Dracula, as he is now
known, has taken up residence in a manor in the northern part of the
realm, commanding his minions from his lair. It is rumored that he has
been killed many times, only to rise again; for he is cursed and Vl'arescht
refuses his soul in all the higher planes.

1 'TREE OF LIFE'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50


The origin of all life on Despair can be traced back to the Tree of Life.
Weaved by the essence of magic ages ago, the Tree grew the beginnings of
all existence; from the lowliest insect to the wisest of sages. Many have
visited the Tree through a magical portal leading into the past from the
present, those who return speak of many powerful entities who reside there.
~

53 TRIGGER~
A trigger is an action, phrase, or game event that causes a program
held within a room, mob or object, to begin playing out its commands.
 
Triggers can be anything from a player or mob entering a room, to a
player stating a particular phrase within a room, or to a mob or an
object.
 
For detailed information on triggers, see:
 
RPTRIGGERS, MPTRIGGERS, OPTRIGGERS
~

1 'TROLL DEN'~
Recommended level range: 10 - 20

A small group of trolls resides in the darker regions of Haon Dor.
These filthy creatures often wander the forest, seeking lone adventurers
to knock unconscious and bring back to their den for dinner. Though
they do not number many, their numbers appear to be multiplying at a
fast rate...
~

0 'TROLLISH VIGOR' TROLLISH VIGOR~
This spell increases your stamina during its duration.
~

57 'TRUE SIGHT'~
Syntax:  cast 'true sight'
 
This spell can only be cast upon yourself.  It is a combination of
infravision (enabling you to see in the dark), detect invisible,
and detect hidden.  This spell also allows you to see through
blinding attacks.
~

1 TRUE TRUESIGHT~
Syntax:  cast truesight
Syntax:  c true
 
Truesight confers the caster with a very brief immunity to blindness
(from attacks such as gouge or the blindness spell itself).  While
under the spell's effect, the caster continues to see.  Be warned
that when the spell wears off the caster will become blind should
the effects of the blinding attack still remain.
Truesight cannot be cast on anyone but the caster itself.
~

60 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.

~

1 TUMBLE~
Syntax:  operates independently
 
Tumble is a high-level thief skill for the evasion of incoming attacks.
The skill functions autonomically, and its effectiveness is greater for
more dexterous thieves.
 
~

1 'TWO RIVERS'~
Recommended level range: 1 - 15
 
The small farming and hunting town of Two Rivers lies north of the
Shire, across the shimmering Brandywine River. Its people are mere
peasants and offer very little aid in the battle against Darkness.
~

59 UNFOLDAREA~
Syntax:  unfoldarea <area filename>
 
This command will load up an area file.
 
NOTE:  It could be quite dangerous to unfold an area that is already
       loaded, or one that has not been tested.
 
~

1 'UNHOLY GROUNDS'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 15

As you walk through this hellish cemetery, before the graves of those torn
from life before their time, you can hear the mournful cries of those
left behind.  A bell tolls in the distance, announcing the passing of
yet another lost soul.  A preacher speaks from a shoddy chapel, giving
hollow words of comfort to the mourners gathered there.  The vileness of
this place permeates your clothing, attacking your every sense.  Ghoulish
corpses littering the ground, unholy statues with the heads of gargoyles,
and a vile mausoleum filled with bloody carcasses rotting away - these are
the visions which assault your mind.
~

1 'UNRAVEL DEFENSE'~
Syntax: c 'unravel defense' <victim>
 
This spell renders the victim susceptible to both magic and nonmagic attacks.
~

1 UPLIFT~
Syntax:  c uplift <target>
 
Uplift is a cleric spell that can heal from afar, meant to be used in 
aiding players with negative hitpoints.
Uplift is not to be used as your common mode of healing.  Repeatedly asking
for uplifts on public channels is spammy and annoying for other players.  
Keep in mind that the clerics that are uplifting you are doing so out of 
kindness.  Do _not_ abuse it or consider it a right.
~

1 UPPERCUT~
Syntax:  uppercut
 
Uppercut is a skill which can only be used once a fight has started,
and can only be used against your primary opponent.  If it successfully
lands, it inflicts damage on your opponent.
~

54 USEPROG~
Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~

54 USERS~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.
~

0 VALIANCE~
This spell increases your perserverence when you are on the verge of
losing consciousness.
~

1 'VALLEY OF THE ELVES'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 20

The Valley of the Elves lies far to the north of Darkhaven, beyond the
great Mount Olympus. The tribal, uncivilized elves of Despair reside
in the valley, oblivious to all the pain and destruction which occurs
while they sing, dance and hunt. A single elf is involved in aiding
the forces of Light: Talemon the Archmage. Trained at the High Tower
of Sorcery and considered noble by all, he is well-respected in
courts throughout the Realms and his insight has often saved many lives.
~

0 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES~
.
Vampires are one of the powerful creatures of the Realms.  Being a creature
of the undead, they require copious quantities of fresh blood.  Instead of
using mana, Vampires use blood points (bp) for spell casting.  If a Vampire
takes a large amount of damage, Blood points will be lost, but, Blood points
can give a small surge of hit points (hp) in battle when needed.  As a undead
creature of the night, Vampires recieve an armor class (ac) bonus at night,
a time when they can use the skill mistwalk.

lands, it inflicts damage on your opponent.
~

0 VENTRILOQUATE~
Syntax: cast ventriloquate <speaker> <message>

This spell throws your voice, making it appear that some other object or
character in the room is saying your message.  Victims who make their saving
throw will know that someone is using ventriloquism, but not who.  Victims who
fail their saving throw will think that the object or character really did say
your message.
~

1 'VILLAGE OF EDO'~
Recommended level range: 35 - 50

To the northwest of Old Thalos is a small village populated by fierce
warriors. For years, the warriors of Edo have been training their art
of self-defence and attack. They have finally accomplished their holy
quest and have now joined the five cities of Light in the battle against
Evil. Though they do not have the numbers to contribute, the training
they provide largely outweighs this inconvenience.
~

55 VNUMS~
Syntax: vnums [low] [high]

Lists the vnum range for rooms/mobs/objects in all prototype areas.
~

1 'VOMICA PRAVUS'~
Syntax:  vomica <victim>
    or:  vom    <victim>
 
A truly depraved afflicition which may be inflicted by a vampire upon
its victim, this curse will weaken an opponent's hitroll and damage
roll, deprive them of precious luck and curse them for a brief time.
The damroll and hitroll affects of this curse increase with the level
of the vampire.
~

1 VOTING VOTE VOTES~
Syntax: note vote <number> open/close/yes/no/abstain
 
Once a note has been posted on a bulletin board, the author may open
voting with 'note vote <number> open'.  All those who can read the
board may then vote on the issue in the note with 'note vote <number>
yes/no/abstain'. The author may close the voting; the syntax for that
should be clear enough.
 
Note list will show whether a note is not a voting note, open to voting
or closed to voting.  The character that separates the author and the
recipient in 'note list' will be a colon, a capital V or a capital C
accordingly.
~

58 VSEARCH~
Syntax: Vsearch <vnum>
 
This command will list all instances of an object with that vnum that
are currently in the game. 
~

1 WAR WARTALK~
Syntax:  war <message>
 
Wartalk is a channel created as a haven for those players who like to openly
discuss their exploits in combat - and brag against their opponents.  It is
most often used for those who declare war on other deadlies and is desirable
for those who like to invite others to battles in player versus player
whether it be in the arena or around the Realms.
 
Wartalk can be seen by all players in the game, and has the same
rules as other channels.  No harassment, profanity, spamming, or
inappropriate subject matter.
~

58 WARN ~
Syntax: warn class <field>
Syntax: warn race  <field>
Syntax: warn site  <field>
Field is either #(ban_number) or the site/class/race.
Example:  warn class #1
~

0 WARRIOR WARRIORS~
Warriors are the epitome of fighters, able to use all weaponry and armour
in the exercise of their most lethal of combat skills.  A warrior must be
strong in body to survive his dangerous lifestyle, and though he has no
magic and limited skills he is nevertheless a formidable force with which
to be reckoned.  Warriors learn no magic, and have no use for mana.

51 WATCH~
. &w
&W Syntax: &G watch                  &W Shows you a help screen

&W Syntax: &G watch clear            &W Deletes your watch file
&W Syntax: &G watch show             &W Shows all your active watches
&W Syntax: &G watch player <name>    &W Starts watching a player
&W Syntax: &G watch site <site>      &W Starts watching all players from site
&W Syntax: &G watch delete <number>  &W Stops a watch

&W Syntax: &G watch print 500        &W Shows file starting at line 500
&W Syntax: &G watch print 500 100    &W Shows 100 lines starting at line 500

Watch will work 24 hours a day from the time you put a watch on a player until
you take it off. You can also watch all players from a specific site.
 
We need you to be real careful about the size of your watch file. If you
are watching a number of players or sites, please do not just forget about
your watches and allow your watch file to grow to outrageous sizes. You
should never have more than 5,000 or 10,000 lines in your watch file.
If you are doing some watching, be sure you check your watch file daily
and either print it, display it, copy it to your hard drive or do whatever
you need to do with it but then ... please ... please ... be sure you
clear it so that it don't grow huge and eat up all our hard drive space.
If you clear your watch file daily ... there should be no problem. If you
aren't watching anyone ... you don't have to worry about this. But if you
start a watch, it is your responsibility to know how big your watch file
is and to stop the watch when you no longer need it. The command
&G"watch size" &W tells you how many lines are in your watch file.
The command &G"watch clear"&W clears (deletes) your watch file.
For the time being the maximum number of lines you can display at one time
is 1000. So ... even if you have 5,000 lines in your watch file ... you can
only display 1,000 at a time.

~

1 WEAPONS~
Weapons are the primary source of fighting power for most classes,
especially at lower levels where other skills and spells remain
unlearned. To use a weapon, simply 'wield <weapon name>'. You will
hit more frequently with a weapon which is suited to your class, so
choose your weapon wisely. For instance, mages use short blades at 95%
efficiency. A mage wielding a long blade would hit his/her target less
frequently, dependant upon the hitroll of the weapon in hand. Also, be
sure to practice and adept your favored weapontype for best results.
~

53 WEAPONTYPES~
For items of type "weapon", the value3 field specifies the weapon type:

Wisdom is the prime attribute of druids and clerics.
 
~

51 WIZHELP~
Syntax: wizhelp

WIZHELP provides a list of all the immortal commands.
~

51 WIZINVIS~
All immortals have the responsibility to be available to others whenever
possible, be they mortal or immortal.  When the use of wizinvis is called
for, the following are parameters for its use:
 
 - Immortals level 51 through 54 should be visible at all times, save
   for when snooping, running a quest or some similar circumstance.
 
 - Immortals level 55 and up may invis to any level at their discretion.
 
Guidelines for use of wizinvis by 55 and higher:
It is considered mandatory to be visible to all other immortals whenever
reasonably able to do so.  Using wizinvis beyond 51 to facilitate work on
a project, allow concentration on something, avoid excessive tells or the
like is fine, but it should only be used while necessary.
 
Guidelines for use of wizinvis beyond 51 in immortal channels:
Sightings of Someones in immortal channels should be kept to a minimum.
If you are free enough to be able to use an immortal channel, you should
be visible to the lowest immortal in that channel; no higher than 54 in
Muse, no higher than 51 in immtalk, etc.  Being a Someone to anyone on
an immortal channel should only occur if you're too tied up to go
visible but need to make a comment.
 
The same applies to all situations using channels, tells or actions.
Avoid being a Someone to mortals and immortals alike unless you have
a good reason to do otherwise.

0 WYVERN 'WYVERN TOWER' 'WYVERNS TOWER'~
Recommended level range: 5 - 30
 
Crafted ages ago from the black magics of an evil cult, the Wyvern's Tower
was conquered two decades ago by the forces of Light. They set the tower on 
fire and left, believing that holy fire would finish the deed of purging the 
evil of the place. However, only months after, many races of Darkness began 
creeping back, making the tower's hallowed halls their home once again. The 
forces of Light, unfortunately, have not the time to deal with such minor 
threats. So, a group powerful enough to completely destroy the creatures 
within the tower has never risen to the challenge. The Wyvern's Tower has 
been used of late for training and testing of new initiates of Good.

...Everything begins to fade to black.

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
more free than you have ever felt before...

pulling sensation as strange and colorful mists swirl around you...
