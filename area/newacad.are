You have experienced open exits and closed doors to this point. There are
also hidden doors. The hidden door can not be found with the "bump" method.
Often they will not show up with the "look" method either. These exits are
found by reading room descriptions, mobiles descriptions and looking at
objects. You are looking for words that stand out, those words will be the
door name. You will also find doors that are locked. You may get past some
locked doors with the pass door spell, the pick door skill or bash door skill.
Some doors may only be passed by using the matching key. Other exits you
may find require you to be skilled in climb or affected by the fly spell.
All exits are in real directions that can be abbreviated to the following:
N, E, W, S, NE, NW, SE, SW, U, or D. There are also SOMEWHERE exits that
use "leave", "climb", "enter", or just a word to use. To the north you

Desc     This room explains about WIMPY, FLEE, and RECALL as a way to leave from
combat. Wimpy is an automatic withdrawal from a fight when your hitpoints
reach a set minimum. To set your wimpy, type WIMPY or WIMPY <number>. The
number being the amount of hitpoints you want remaining when you leave the
battle. You will lose experience for wimpying out of a fight, but the amount
of experience lost will generally be less then the amount lost from death.
You may also manually withdraw from a fight with flee. To use flee, just
type FLEE. You may flee out of the fight at any amount of hitpoints. Fleeing
will cost you loss of experience. You may also "recall" from a fight. This
is done with the spell "word of recall" or reciting a recall scroll. You 
lose more experience when you recall from a fight then when you use wimpy
or flee. Recall should be used as a last resort.

purpose is to cast spells of armor, bless, cure blindness, cure poison, 
cure light, and refresh. The healer casts these spells randomly to the
characters in the room. Some healers have programs that will allow you
to purchase certain spells for coins. Others have programs that will give
you a spell when you say a certain word or phrase, or do a certain social
to them. It is important to look at mobiles to read their descriptions.
Many will have hints in their descriptions that will tell you what to
say or do to get their favor.

how the programs on the mobs and items work. It will help you later in your

type WHO 51 and ask an immortal for assistance. I wish you well in your

commonly known as a DT. A death trap is exactly as its name states, a
room that causes your death. Unlike a regular death, you do not lose
your hitpoints and you do not leave a corpse behind. All the items you 
were wearing and carrying are destroyed. You do not leave a corpse behind.
You are then transported back to the Temple in Darkhaven. Going west will

All exits, except down, lead to a CAGE mob. Some of these cage mobs may be
aggressive and will attack you upon entering their room. As you kill them,
you will gain experience, as well as academy equipment and gold. Once you
have defeated a mob, type GET ALL CORPSE to loot the coins and equipment.
You may also type CONFIG +AUTOLOOT or CONFIG +AUTOGOLD. Autoloot will take
everything from the corpse when you kill it. Autogold will take only the
gold from the corpse. When you loot a corpse of equipment, the items are
transferred to your inventory. You may suffer injury during the battle, so
return here and type REST or SLEEP. This will speed your healing process.
When you are finished healing, type WAKE or STAND to continue.

does not welcome strangers.

Desc     To the north is a craggy rock wall of the cavern, covered in a slimy
film of an unknown source.  From all directions you are assaulted by
howls of pain, and cries of death.  Moisture clings to your skin,
making you feel much hotter then you should for the air temperature.

Desc     You sink a few inches into the mud that makes up the floor of this
cavern. Darkness and noise punctuate the devestating nothingness
that fills this space.  If there is life to be found in this place,
you are sure you do not want to run across it.
