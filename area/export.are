Long       Wilam, the Cult Torturer, is ready to inflict great pain upon you.
~
Desc       This is one of the most handsome men you have ever seen. His hair is
a fiery red, shoulder length and wavy. His face has the ruged chiseled
look. His muscles are well defined, but not overly large. You can not
believe someone like this could torture people...  that is until he
smiles. There is an odd twist to his mouth, something dark and flickering
behind the eyes. A calculating madness lurks deep within that disturbing
smile. Resisting the urge to shiver, you pull your eyes away.

dragon, larger then any you have seen in your adventures.  The
beast looks to stand about 40 feet from ground to nose tip and the
beasts body is about 300 feet long based by the the buildings in
the background.  At his feet are several men, all kneeling, and a
female dressed in white.  You think the artist captured a virgin

one dragon with a detailed background.  The pictures are arranged with
one in the center and the other four positioned around it.  The center
picture is that of a wyrmling, named because it looks like a serpent
with wings.  The painting at 2'oclock is of a smallish brown dragon in
a background of budding trees and new grasses of early spring.  The
painting at 4'oclock is that of a golden colored dragon basking in the
bright sun of mid-summer.  The painting at 8'oclock is a large red dragon
surrounded by falling leaves of the autumn season.  The final picture,
placed at 10'oclock to the wyrmling, represents a huge dragon of the
deepest black perched on a snow-covered cliffside.

ExDesc       On the east wall there are five small paintings.  Each painting features
one dragon with a detailed background.  The pictures are arranged with
one in the center and the other four positioned around it.  The center
picture is that of a wyrmling, named because it looks like a serpent
with wings.  The painting at 2'oclock is of a smallish brown dragon in
a background of budding trees and new grasses of early spring.  The
painting at 4'oclock is that of a golden colored dragon basking in the
bright sun of mid-summer.  The painting at 8'oclock is a large red dragon
surrounded by falling leaves of the autumn season.  The final picture,
placed at 10'oclock to the wyrmling, represents a huge dragon of the
deepest black perched on a snow-covered cliffside.

ExDescKey    w west~
ExDesc       The two tapestries on the west wall feature an early spring and
a summer scene.  The spring tapestry is a portrait of a smallish
brown dragon, perched on a hillside.  The trees around him are just
beginning to bud with new leaves and the grass has that bright, new
growth, green.  The dragon looks very prideful, sitting upright, it's
tail twisted in several loops, crossing the front of his hind legs.
His eyes are an orange color and seem to follow as you move.  His 
wings are touching above his back, somewhat flexed in case he needs
to take off for a quick flight.  Even in this relaxed, prancing state
this dragon is an impressive desplay of strength.
The summer tapestry is strikingly different.  It catches a majestic
golden dragon in mid flight.  It's wings spread far wider than this
tapestry can hold.  In the background, you can see it is summertime,
the sun out in full heat.  It looks hot, and the dragon appears to
enjoy it immensely.  The dragon flies, eyes closed, far above the
grassy hills.  His tail whipped up behind him, like a scorpion.  He
looks as if nothing could break his utter contentment of flight.

#ENDEXDESC

#EXDESC
ExDescKey    n north~
ExDesc       The two tapestries on the north wall feature an autumn and winter
scene. The autumn tapestry is a portrait of a mammoth red dragon.
He is deep in a forest, surrounded by gorgeous leaves of vivid
colors of fall.  His is sitting on his hind legs, his tail wrapped
around them.  His front legs are perched lightly on his tail, allowing
his to stand taller than if he were on all fours.  His chest appears
puffed up, like he is trying to look even more large then he already
is. He definitely makes a magestic statement, even in this medium.
The winter tapestry is so well done, it appears that your fingers would
freeze upon touching it.  It lacks much in the way of color, just the
stark white of frozen winter and the deepest black of the immense
dragon perching on the iced cliff.  The harsh contrast of the dragons
coloring to the background is shocking, stealing the more exact
deletes of it's being.

doorway, leading away from the stairwell.  In the middle of the floor
is a gaping whole, leading to the bottom of the pit.  You can see
movement below, but have trouble finding the cause.  Should you explore
below, investigate to the east, or return to relative safety above?

Desc     As you stand at the bottom of this staircase, you wonder why anyone
would want to be down here.  The darkness is so dense as to have an
almost physical presence.  The result is oppressive.  The cold, harsh
stone walls seem to close in on you as you listen to the mezmerizing
chants coming from the south.
