thin wisps of fog that cover the ground, causing you to huddle closely to
the black granite headstone before you, marking the grave of a tortured
soul that has resigned its corpse.  Looking closely at the headstone, you
notice several deep cracks forming across its face, caused by careless
chisel marks left behind by thieves attempting to remove the tarnished
brass plaque mounted upon it.  Large twisted roots of a tree to the west
extend beneath the ground, causing you to almost trip over them as they
protrude through the rotten soil which now marks this grave.

Sector   forest~
Flags    dark~
Desc     Clawing your way through the large forest of dead trees and piles of broken
coffins, you find yourself standing in the midst of tall, white oak
trees blooming so thickly that you cannot see the warm bright light of the sun
or the glowing white moon shining through the canopy of foliage.
The ground beneath you is warmly blanketed with thick green grass, untouched by
the hellish gophers that scavenge the area in search of fleshy meals buried
in their cold dark graves deep beneath the cemetary.  Small blue and
white wild flowers grow in patches all throughout the trees.

Desc     Thorny brambles within weeds smother the ground as you continue to follow the
viney path, causing a warm trickle of blood to flow from a wound on your legs
left by the piercing thorns that grow like daggers wildy around you.  In the
distance you hear the mournful toll of a bell, annoucing the passing of another
life, leaving only its corpse behind to be buried within the decaying
graveyard.  The heavy odor of decomposing flesh is thick here, causing you to
gasp for anything that may resemble fresh air as you hope that you will not
be the next resident of this hellish place.

of the grave of the preacher that once spoke words of comfort to mourners
who came to bury their beloved ones.  The large black headstone that marks
this grave stands covered thickly with the same overgrown weeds and thorny
vines growing rampant elsewhere within the cemetery, never cleared away by
the new preacher who now serves as caretaker to the grounds.  Dry brown
flowers, once vibrant with color and scent, now lay lifeless at the base
of the headstone, trampled by uncaring gravediggers as they carry their
coffins from the chapel.  An overgrown trail lies to the northwest.

Desc     Somewhere inside the graveyard, you find yourself standing in front of an
old wooden chapel.  Two rotten wooden steps lead up to the door, savagely
beaten by the weather and splintering in several places; hanging upon rusty
hinges that creak in a bone-shivering moan when opened by gravediggers
performing their ghastly rituals of burying their dead.  Somewhere above you,
an old bell hangs in its belfry, awaiting to announce the final hours in which
all mortals must surrender their lives.  The chapel's roof, sagging with age
and disrepair does little to shelter the mourners, saddened by their loss, 
from the cold wind and rain plaguing the cemetary.

bats that hang silently from the old rotted ceiling.  Cold winds swirl
through the broken shutters that hang miserably upon each wall, causing
you to siver slightly as you look around the room.  Stepping carefully
around the large bell suspended from a beam mounted upon the ceiling,
you notice an old worn rope unravelling slowly from the constant yanking
of the preacher's calloused hands, marking the death of yet another victim.
The tarnished bell, cracked in several places, hangs in a darkened silence
as the winds howl visciously outside, moaning with anticipation for your
soul to join those laid to rest in this sickening place.

of a smiling woman carefully placed on the walls around you.  Large oak

several personal trinkets that once belonged to the tall, slender woman

just enough light to highlight a large cherry chest, housing garments that

A single lock of hair tied with a small red ribbon adorns a tiny white
velvet pillow delicately placed in a rocking chair directly leading to

streaks of dried blood smeared across the face of the stone, flooding
your mind with horrid visions of the struggle which resulted in this

broken tombstones and piles of splintered coffins, their lids barely

akin to the southern ruins of the city, the cemetery lies in the poorest

badly it rains down a perpetual shower of metal flakes, encircles the area
in a vain attempt to keep greedy graverobbers at bay.  Vines of thorn and
weed grow along the length of the fence, enshrouding the cemetery, yet
failing to stave off the stench of rot and decaying flesh that assails your
nostrils.  A large gate, long ago unhinged, lays inextricably entangled in
a lush thicket, forever entombing it within the cold ground.
