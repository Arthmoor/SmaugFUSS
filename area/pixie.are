Desc       This large fellow, a forest dweller, has brown fur which matches his brown
eyes - which very nearly match his yellowish-brown teeth, which he looks to
be interested in matching with your neck, skull and other parts.  The
undisputed ruler of this forest, he is arrogant in his disdain of
your presence.
