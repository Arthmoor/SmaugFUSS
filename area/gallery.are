Oh yeah, and by the way, the Art Gallery was based, in part (a small part) on
Owzer's house, in Final Fantasy III.  Those who've played it know what I mean.

Desc     Ugh.  What an ugly sculpture.  If the artist was trying to make this thing 
beautiful, he should be executed.  The monochromaticity of the bronze only 
adds to this hideous beast's ugliness, with its lower jaw jutting out, its 
too-long, twisted horns, and generally stupid appearance.  Yeccch.

Desc     You vow to never even think about anything bovine once leaving this place.  
Every milk and cheese product you can imagine lies here, carefully kept cool 
by a bluish-white glow.  A sign says, "ALL PRODUCTS KEPT REFRIGERATED".  
You'll have to ask the local scholar what ree-frigg-er-ated means sometime.  
It sounds dangerous.  But the food is so enticing...

Desc     As you step near the two humanoids fighting in this section of the arena, 
they both grow limp and collapse, their eyes rolling back in their heads.  By 
the time you reach them, they are both quite dead.  Looking up in the stands, 
you see one of the mind flayers gurgle something to his companion, and they 
both disappear suddenly.

Desc     Before you can get near the lizardman and warrior, they fall down in a heap 
together, both quite dead.  They didn't kill each other, so what could have 
possibly killed them?  Hmm.  This is unlike anything you've ever seen 
before.  They don't look like they had any history of coronary trouble...how
utterly puzzling.

is no exception.  Aaron's side is covered with clothes and papers, and the 
everpresent brown beanbag chair.  Rob's side is spotless, as usual, except for
a broken bottle of Snapple on the floor.  Neither of them are on the MUD, 
though.  They're not as addicted as the rest of us.
