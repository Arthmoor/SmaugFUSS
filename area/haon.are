Long       A gargantuan, toad-like creature blinks slowly at nothing in particular.
~
Desc       Its head rising a good eight feet off the ground, this is without a doubt
the most incredible amphibian you have ever laid eyes upon ... it doesn't
seem to think too much of you, though.  Thick strands of mucous, thick as
rope, drip from its nostrils while large eyes gleam impassively down upon
you like great black marbles.  A reeking sheen of foamy white goo covers
most of its backside, and every so often it burps a thick glob of the stuff
halfway out of its maw before quickly gobbling it back down.  Froghemoths
are rumoured to enjoy gobbling lots of things down - fish, birds, wargs,
trees, boulders, people, anything it finds to be particularly interesting.
Thank god you're boring as hell.

ExDesc       This book is intended to be a guide to adding programs <a.k.a. progs>
to rooms, objects, and mobs. While mainly intended for builders who
are unfamiliar with progs, those of you who have dabbled will also
benefit from reading this book.
 
This book is not a replacement for the help files found on 5500 and 4k.
Instead, it is an adjunct to those help files. This book gives you an
good understanding of how progs work, how to create them, what to do,
what not to do, what you can and cannot do with progs. the help files,
meanwhile, will offer the more immediate, specific information you need
while creating your progs.
 
If you've ever done any programming before, no matter the language, then 
you'll be able to pick up the knack of writing progs quite well. If you
haven't programmed before, no worries, it's easy enough to pick up.
 
I hope you'll find this book a useful tool in creating some amazing things
to enhance the Realms.

                             WHAT ARE PROGS
 
Progs are simple text files that contain a series of instructions. These
progs are "attached" to a specific room, mob or object. Each prog will
have a triggering mechanism that will set off the prog (except for script
progs which run continuously). Once set in motion, a prog will carry out
the instructions contained within the file in a line by line, step by step
manner.
 
Progs can have conditional checks built in to restrict actions based on
any number of things, from a player's race to whether or not it's a player
or a mob triggering the prog.
 
You will find there is a high degree of flexibility built into the commands
and triggers that you can currently use with progs. However, a prog is not
capable of doing everything, and should certainly not be the only solution
within your building arsenal for spicing up your area.

                            WHEN TO USE PROGS
Progs, by their nature, chew up a fair degree of processor power. So, they
should be used in moderation. They should only be used in situations in
which either:  1) you want certain actions to take place, and you cannot
achieve these actions through any other methods (such as room flags, random
exits in reset lists, etc..); 2) You want to add a little bit of spice or
environment to a particular room, mob or object, and descriptions or eds
are just not enough.
 
Adding a random prog that causes a mob to emote an action, such as a guard
yawning and scratching his ribs as he leans on his spear, can be an elegant
method to add a lot of charm and life to an area. However, too much of a good
thing can be bad. Don't add progs to each and every thing in your area. It
overwhelms the players and takes away from the magic such things can evoke.
 
The biggest area of concern with progs is objects. If a mob has a prog, there
may be only a few copies of the mob in existence at a time. However, if you
put a prog on a food item, we could conceivably end up with literally hundreds
of copies of the item. This could potentially strain system resources and be
a cause of lag.

                                 THE BASICS
 
Creating a prog is much the same as writing a note or creating a description
for a room, mob or object. Use the following to create a prog:
 
Room:    Rpedit add <trigger type> [p] [trigger/time/percentage]
*note*   You must be in the room for which the program is destined,
         and the room must have a prototype flag.
 
Mob:     Mpedit <mob name> add <trigger type> [p] [trigger/time/percentage]
*note*   The mob must be in the room with you, and it must have a
         prototype flag.
 
Object:  Opedit <object name> add <trigger type> [p] [trigger/time/percentage]
*note*   The object must be in your inventory, and it must have a
         prototype flag.

When you wish to make changes to an existing prog, you fist need to determine
which # prog it is within the room/mob/object. You can find this out by typing
the following:
 
Room:    Rpedit list
Mob:     Mpedit <mob name> list
Object:  Opedit <object name> list
 
Then, to get into the editor and make your changes, simply:
 
Room:    Rpedit edit <prog #>
Mob:     Mpedit <mob name> edit <prog #>
Object:  Opedit <object name> edit <prog #>

To delete a prog, simply do the following:
 
Room:    Rpedit delete <prog #>
Mob:     Mpedit <mob name> delete <prog #>
Object:  Opedit <mob name> delete <prog #>
 
There isn't much to say about the internal basics of a program. As the
commands available to you are not as complex as a pure language, you
won't have to worry about things that are too convoluted. Although, you
can certainly create some nice long progs once you get the hang of it.
 
A program consists of:
 
1) A trigger. Which is set in the command line that creates the prog.
2) Optional conditional statements. So the prog reacts to specific people.
3) Commands, echos, says, tells, whatever. ie, what the prog actually does.

                                 TRIGGERS
 
Triggers are, as the name suggests, devices by which programs can be 
activated. Listed below is a summary of the triggers available:
 
Room:   Act,  speech, rand, sleep, rest, entry, fight, death, leave,
        time, hour.
Mob:    Act,   speech, rand,   fight, hitprcnt, greet, allgreet, entry,
        bribe, death,  script, time,  hour.
Object: Wear,   remove, speech, rand, sac,  zap,  get, drop, damage,
        repair, greet,  exa,    look, push, pull, use.
 
When you set most trigger types, you also set a percentage chance for 
success. ie, if you have a fight prog on a mob with a 40% chance of
success, then when a fight starts, there's a 40% chance the prog will 
kick in during each round of the fight. The progs that do not use a 
percentage modifier are:
 
        Act, speech, time, hour, script.
 
On succeeding pages, I will go into short explanations of each trigger
to give you an idea of when and how to use it. Type Look 4-2 to see the

                                 TRIGGERS (cont'd...)
 
ACT - an act prog reacts to specific actions that take place in front of the 
mob, or room that has the prog. These actions take the form of Socials (wave,
clap, bounce, etc..); actions (such as moving from room to room, opening a 
door, a player arriving in a puff of smoke. Basically any activity that some
one else in the room would see); and bamf's (the arriving and leaving messages
that follow imortals around when they use Goto). 
Whatever triggering action you choose should make sense with the resulting 
program. ie, an act prog that triggers with the moocow social by echoing 
respectful greetings to the triggering individual would not fit quite well 
(in most cases). However, an act prog that triggers with a player bowing and
responds with respectful greetings would be quite apropos.
Because the act prog uses a unique sample of the text seen on the screen when
the appropriate action takes place (ie, 'bows before you' for the Bow social),
it is imperitive to use the [p] option. Let's try an example to show you how
it works. We'll use the Bow social on a mob named Mobbie.
 
          Mpedit mobbie add act p bows before you.
  versus
          Mpedit mobbie add act bows before you.

                                 TRIGGERS (cont'd...)
 
The [p] before the triggering text tells the program to treat the words of
the triggering text as one single group, rather than as individual triggers.
 
We'll examine how these two progs will react using three different instances
of the Bow social. 1) Player_X bows, with no target in mind; 2) Player_X bows
to Player_Y; 3) Player_X bows to the mob Mobbie. What Mobbie sees (for
triggering purposes) is: 1)  Player_X bows deeply; 2)  Player_X bows before
Player_Y; 3)  Player_X bows before you.
 
Now, in the case of the first mob prog we set up, using the [p] signifier,
only in case #3 would the prog trigger. This is because all three words
plus the period match up perfectly as the triggering mechanism. Meanwhile,
in the case of the second mob prog we set up. Each of the three words act
as individual triggers (ie, bows, before, and you). This means that in case
#1, the program would be triggered once by the word 'bows'. In case #2, the
program would be triggered twice. Once by 'bows', and once by 'before'. In
case #3, the program would trigger three times in succession. Once for each
of the three triggering words.

Even if you have an instance in which you want all variants of a social being
triggered, and you think that omitting the [p] will save you space and hassle
by creating only one prog, you are opening yourself up for problems. There
is too much of a chance that some other social or action may be triggered by
one of the individual words you use in your triggering text. I can think of
no instance in which omitting the [p] can be safely justified. If there's a
social you wish covered from every angle, simply take the time to create an
individual prog for each instance of the social.
 
SPEECH - A speech prog is triggered by SAY's or TELL's that originate from
within the same room as the room, mob or object. Speech triggers need to
be specific enough and unique enough that they are not inadvertantly set
off by casual conversation. Again, as with the act prog discussed earlier,
the use of the [p] is critically important. The phrase you choose as your
triggering mechanism is something that you want to be fairly unique, and
one that requires some effort on the part of the player to discover. If
you did not use the [p] when setting the trigger, then any single word
from the text string you denote could set off the prog. Not only that, but
you would then run the risk of the prog going off in multiples, depending
on how many occurances of each word is imbedded within the players SAY or
TELL.    .... Continued on page 4-5. Type Look 4-5.

There is no way to have a tell only or say only prog trigger. So, special
care needs to be taken when setting the trigger phrase. Any tell, no matter
where it's destination, that originates within the room in which the room,
mob or object prog is residing, can set off a speech prog (assuming the 
trigger phrase is stated). Most importantly then, uniqueness is the 
cornerstone of speech progs. You have to take into consideration the chance
of the trigger phrase coming up in casual conversation within earshot of the
room/mob/object. As an example, let's say the trigger was the phrase 'take a
hike'. Now, what if Player_X and Player_Y were bantering back and forth in
tells, and as Player_X walks into the room with Mobbie, he TELL's Player_Y 
"aww Frank, take a hike will ya?". Suddenly, funking things are happening to
Player_X.
 
RAND - A rand program is a random program that kicks in based on a percentage
that is set by you upon it's creation. Every round, the game checks the rand 
prog's percentage against a random generator. When they match, the prog kicks
in. A rand prog will not kick in at all unless there is at least one player
in the area (with 'area' signifying the area range in which the prog resides).

The number of players in an area has no bearing on the frequency of the prog
kicking in. There has been a general misconception amongst some builders that
the rand prog increases in triggering frequency as more and more players enter
the area or room in which the prog resides. This increased frequency is due to
the $r variable that is quite often used in rand and other progs. This will be
discussed in the chapter on Variables.
Some experimentation will be required for you to see what rand setting will be
appropriate for each one that you create. Most rand progs have a setting of 5
or less percent. Anything higher generally causes spammage for players in the 
vicinity of the prog. But, again, this will depend on the nature of the 
intended prog, and your preferance.
Sometimes, even a rand setting of 1% may seem too frequent for your tastes. If
such is the case, look into using a more specific triggering device. No one
trigger will fit all situations.
