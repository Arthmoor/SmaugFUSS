Desc     Welcome to the immortal community of Realms of Despair!
Being an immortal is not all the fun and games of being a mortal...
It involves some responsibility, common sense, and some creative role-
playing too.

                      THE COMMANDMENTS
                      ----------------

1) Absolutely NO helping mortals out to an unfair advantage!
   This includes:
     - giving, selling or auctioning equipment to mortals
     - giving gold to mortals
     - assisting mortals in killing mobiles/monsters
     - giveaway hints and clues to locations... secret doors... etc.
     - corpse retrievals are up to your own descretion... use your
       best judgement. You are allowed to cast kindred strength and
       give detect invisible to mortals when doing CR's, if required.
     - if there is no one else to help a newbie get started, or a newbie
       loses their newbie equipment for some strange reason, you ARE
       permitted to give them a little assistance (levels 1-5 only).

Desc     2) Switching into a mobile is a power given to you to make the game more
   interesting to mortals.  Care must be taken to play the role of the
   mobile... don't act silly, or say "hey! it's me Joe!"  And please
   avoid using the chat channels too much while switched.
   Be sure NOT to do anything to make the mobile harder or easier to kill
   and never reveal statistics of the mobile to any players... ie: hit
   points, gold, items carried, hitroll/damroll etc.

3) Set a good example for the mortals... You are there to keep an eye
   on things... moderate the chat channels, break up arguments, get rid
   of nuisance players... etc.  Summon or transfer any "problem" players
   to room #6 (HELL).  All conversation in that location will be LOGGED
   for review purposes... Don't warn the players about it... ;)

4) Keep an eye on other immortals.  Report any problems to a higher god,
   or to me, Thoric.  Send me email: Thoric@realms.game.org if need be.

5) We are all here to have fun.  There are certain rules to ensure that
   players don't get out of hand, and ruin the game for everyone. There
   are also rules for you to make sure that you don't ruin the game for
   everyone either. Use your own common sense. If in question, ask a
   higher level god. Immortality is a privilage, not a right.

into the mud. Although there is no set timeline for its completion, steady
progress on the area is expected.
*A creator is expected to demonstrate a willingness to offer constructive
input into the operarion of the mud.
*A creator is expected to demonstrate the ability to deal with problem
situations without the assisttance of higher level immortals.

the council will want to observe a potential candidtate for a period of
time prior to making a recommendation.

Desc     1) No form of harassment or spamming will be tolerated.  Spamming is
repeatedly communicating to one or more players a message in a 
short duration of time.
 
2) The only form of player killing allowed is between two players whose
names appear under the "Deadly Clans" section of the who list.  Even
in this case the parties must be withing 10 levels of each other.
 
3) Profanity and other lewd comments will not be tolerated.  Please 
remain civil when communicating with others.
 
4) Do not attack or cast spells on any of the Darkhaven storekeepers.  If
it displays its wares when you type list it is a storekeeper.
 
5) When any rank of Immortal speaks with you answer their questions quickly
and honestly.  This will help to ensure things stay fair for all players
and that any issues that arise are taken care of promptly.

range is lower then that of the monster's level.  (See areas command
for a listing of areas and their level range)
 
8) Multiplaying is allowed to those not listed in the "Deadly Clans" 
section of the who list.  If any of your characters appears in this
section of the who list do not bring any of your other charcters online.
 
9) Finally, if you have any problems with the game or players please feel
free to contact any visible immortal logged on.  If none are present
do not take action yourself, rather post a note in the board room

Sector   inside~
Flags    nomob indoors noastral~
Desc     Within these halls are the standard rules and guidelines of area
building. To the aspiring creator, these rules should be followed as
much as possible.

THEME --- Before beginning your area, check to make sure no one is using
  your area theme in mind. Try to have a single idea in your area, rather
  than many smaller, conflicting ones. Since we are playing in the "Realms
  of Despair," the area should have a dark, occult feel to it. No items,
  mobs or rooms in the area should be futuristic or even close to modern
  day.
MAZES --- The creation of mazes is encouraged, for it gives the player a
  mental challenge. However, the area council will not carefully go through
  it. It is up to the creator to pass through every room and make sure it
  works properly.
AREA APPROVAL --- When your area is completed, go through it a couple times
  to make sure everything is as you want it. Upon doing so, post a note to
  the area council and they will get around to checking and authorizing it.

Name     The Hall of Creation --- Rooms~
Sector   inside~
Flags    nomob indoors noastral~
Desc     Here are the general rules to be followed when making your rooms.
 
ROOM NAMES --- Standard names should have all important words capitalized
  and should end with no punctuation mark.
  Good example: Wandering the Dark Lands of Ered Mithik
  Bad example:  Wandering The Dark Lands Of Ered Mithik.
DESCRIPTIONS --- Skimpy 2-3 sentence room descriptions should be avoided
  as much as possible. The description should invoke a mental image of
  the room. Builders should try to avoid describing player actions and
  emotions in a description, as well as the presence and actions of a
  mobile in the room (use mobprograms for those).
SECTORS --- All room sectors must be filled out. Note that the inside
  sector signifies that there is a roof over the player's head, while
  the city sector means there is none. All rooms with the inside sector
  must be accompanied by the indoors flag.
FLAGS --- Room flags should be carefully thought out so you understand
  how the players will get to and fight in certain room, as well as how
  difficult it will be for them to retrieve their corpse.
EXDESCS --- Exit descriptions should be filled in, especially ones that
  lead in/out of building and other places of import. An exdesc for a DT
  is absolutely necessary.
ROOM PROGS --- Feel free to use room programs if needed. These can be used
  to confuse players or add mood. Depending on your creativity however,
  there are many things possible with room progs. (This is for level 54+)

Sector   inside~
Flags    nomob indoors noastral~
Desc     Here are the general rules to be followed when making your mobs.
 
MOB NAMES --- The short description of a mob is up to the builder, yet
  should never have any kind of ending punctuation. Also, don't capitalize
  words like 'of' or 'the'.
NPC RACES, CLASSES AND BODYPARTS --- All new mobs should have these filled
  in. Although they do not affect anything at the moment, they will in the
  future.
HITDIE --- The hitnumdie+hitsizedie+hitplus should be used to determine
  a mob's hp.
  Example: 2d5+10 means 12-20 hp. If you want to have a mob's hp always set
  to the same thing, put the hitnumdie and hitsizedie to 1 and set the
  hitplus to the hp desired.
DAMDIE --- This is the amount of damage the mobile does with each non-
  wielding attack. It uses the same system as hitdie.
NUMATTACKS --- This is the number of attacks the mobile can have each round,
  be sure to fill it in.
LANGUAGES --- Make sure all your mobiles are speaking and can understand
  the proper languages. If you wish to ensure that all players will be able
  to understand it, have it speak common.
MOB DESCS: All mobs should have a description upon looking at them.
MOB RIS: Mobiles can have all kinds of resists, suscepts and immunities.
  However, if the mobile has an immunity to anything, it MUST have immune
  charm also.

Flags    nomob indoors noastral~
Desc     Continuation of mobile guidelines and beginning of object rules.
 
MOBILE DIFFICULTY --- Be sure that your mobiles are not a piece of cake
  for their equipment and also for leveling. High level mobs which do
  very little or no damage will not be accepted due to the lack of
  difficulty for levelling.
MOBPROGS --- Mob programs are starting to become a standard thing on many
  mobiles. Feel free to use them in a number of ways. The mppractice and
  mpadvance commands should not be used without permission from the area
  council. (This is for level 54+)
 
OBJECT NAMES --- The short description of an object should follow the same
  rules as a room name: no ending punctuation and capitalization of
  important words only. However, the builder may leave his words without
  capital letters at his discretion.
  Good examples: 'lifebane' 'the Ring of Wizardry'
  Bad example: 'The Devilish Blade Of Lore.'
RIS AND AFFECTS --- RIS (Resistant, immune and susceptible) and spell affects
  can be placed on objects. Certain things will not be accepted however.
  Immunities and affect_santuary, _shockshield, _fireshield or _iceshield
  will not be approved. Susceptibilities are ok. Resists and other affects
  are ok also, but should be relatively rare. A list of items with affects
  or any RIS should be made and sent to the area council.

Desc     Continuation of object rules.
 
OBJECT POWER --- Use your good judgement to decide how powerful your items
  should be. Try comparing the difficulty of reaching and killing your
  mobile to the difficulty of reaching and killing other mobs with similar
  equipment which are currently in the game.
OBJECT PROGS --- Feel free to use object programs to enhance the theme of
  your objects. Obj progs that cast spells or aid the the player in any
  way should be listed for approval with the RIS and affects. (This is for
  level 54+)
 
There are the general rules to be followed. Thank you for showing an
interest in contributing to the Realms of Despair.

Desc     Wading into this small body of water, you frolic in the
cool water. The water here isn't quite as cold as that from
the shore as it has collected here and has been warmed by the
sun. The splish-splash of your footsteps sounds like a small
snare drum being struck in the midst of an orchestra of large
kettle drums. The waves crash against a rock nearby and sends
the spray into your face and drenches your body. A large albatross
sitting opposite you opens it's mouth to caw, but decides that it's
pretty obvious what's so funny. Admonishing your wet clothes you
strip them off slowly and leave them on a rock. Without a moment
of hesitation you sit right down into the water....ker-plop.

Desc     The ancient Inconnu strive endlessly to attain Golconda, the personal
perfection of knowledge, ability, and control over the bestial self of
the vampire.  The mastery of one aspect serves only to mark a beginning
anew of the trek for perfection down new paths.  Largely indifferent to
joy or sorrow, pleasure or pain, and choosing to live in seclusion from
the world they often despise, the Inconnu care little for their lesser
brethren yet harbor no inherent desire to bring harm.  Slow to anger,
but formidable when aroused, their elder status and power affords
them an uncommon respect.
 
The Inconnu are led by Eric, and worship the god Blodkai.

slaughtering the weak and subjugating the innocent.  Fiercely loyal,
highly knowledgeable and shunning of outsiders, Darkblade existed
solely to kill and die for the greater glory of the clan.  Yet where
enemies alone failed, time, corruption and sloth succeeded in bringing
the once-proud clan to the brink of destruction.  It now attempts to
begin anew with a fresh start and a clean slate, returning to the old
ways and ideals that once made clan Darkblade the bane of the Realms.
Darkblade is led by Monica, and worships the god Scarab.

Desc     As if awakening from an unsettlingly surreal dream, you find yourself in
unfamiliar surroundings far from whence you came.  As the torpor wears
off and your eyes begin to refocus, you realize you have been brought
here by the Gods to receive a message of relative import.  Checking
through your inventory, you look for some sign of indication to validate
your purpose and assure you that the deconstruction of your mind has not
yet been put into play.
