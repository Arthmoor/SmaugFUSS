ExDesc       Ages ago, in a far off place, there existed a great nation of gnomes.
Builders, tinkers, scientists, they created great and wondrous things.
With their inventive minds and quirky sense of humor, they made their
lands into a marvel of sight and delight.  Travellers, coming to this
land would, oft-times be baffled by the odd and sometimes mysterious
inventions that abounded.
 
During their expansions, the gnomes at one time came upon a tribe of
hobgoblins.  Slovenly and somewhat dull, the hobgoblins still somehow
won the hearts of the gnomes.  Taking them in, the gnomes began trying
to better the lot of the hobgoblins by teaching them the many ways of
building and invention.  The hobgoblins took a great interest in these
things and strove to make the skills their own.  Cunning and sneaky
though they are, the hobgoblins nonetheless lacked the intelligence to
truly grasp the finer points of what the gnomes were teaching.
 
Finally, one day, the hobgoblins came to decide that the gnomes must
be hiding some vital knowledge from them - that the gnomes just wanted
control over them.  This they could understand, it being their nature
to understand things from this point of view.  They rebelled.  Taking
up arms, they attacked and tried to overthrow their benefactors.  The
resulting war shattered the gnome nation, driving pockets of gnomes
to the far reaches of the realms.

ExDesc       To the east is a small gnome village.  A fragment of the once great
nation of gnomes.  Quiet and peaceful, they have made their home here
in an attempt to find rest at last.  However, a recent development has
shattered that dream.  An advance group of hobgoblins has set up camp
in the caves further to the east.  They are extending the system of
caves there to make space for the rest of their tribe, which is
still some months away.
 
Contact has only recently been made between the hobgoblins and the
gnomes here.  An unsteady peace currently exists, but may end at any
moment.  Several gnomes have already gone missing.
 
Explore here cautiously, there are many things to discover.  Remember
to use the LOOK comand often.  You never know what you may find.
 
This area is designed for levels 5 through 20 approximately.

ExDesc       The area to the east is populated with two distinct groups.
Gnomes, who are tinkerers, scientists, cheerful, meticulous,
and good natured, occupy the village just to the east. The
Hobgoblins, who are sneaky, coniving, envious, slovenly, and
have an evil temperment, have been mining and extending their
influence within caves further to the east. A long standing
rivalry has existed between these two societies. To date, it
remains unresolved.
 
The level range for this area is from level 5 to approximately
level 20. Use caution and care when exploring. Make use of the
LOOK command to find many hidden details of these two groups.

pile of straw acts as a bed, while a simple stool and small table
make up the rest of the furnishings. Remarkeably, although every
item within the room is suffering from the effects or dampness and
rot, the room is quite neat. Whichever poor soul has been forced to
make this his home has taken great care to keep the place liveable.

Desc     The cavern comes to a sharp abrupt end here.  Some shifting of the
