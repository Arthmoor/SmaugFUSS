Short      Samylla~
Long       The Realms of Despair hostess is here to greet you.
~
Desc       This is a woman, that is obvious, yet she does not quite fit what you
are used to a female looking like.  You can not place what it is at
first.  As you look her over, you see she is tall and quite slim, and
her figure is one to attract eyes.  As you glance again over her face
you notice her face is quite white, almost brilliantly so.  Her eyes
are black as coal, no pupil distinguishable from the iris.  She smiles
as she watches your mind turn to take in her appearance, and that is
the last piece of missing information.  You notice the small fanged
eyeteeth, and realize this is a vampire standing before you.  What
world have you stepped into?

Desc       This is a man who eyes speak volumes, mostly of knowledge and friendship.
Most dwarves are distrustful of strangers, but this one seems to thrive
on greeting and teaching the new travelers into these Realms.  His face
is covered in wrinkles, both from the sun and smiling.  His chin sprouts
a proud goatee, and his clothes are bright to the point of being gaudy.
His boots are a black leather, polished to a shine.  Overall, he makes

If your name has been approved, you will be sent into the actual game.
 
If you receive a message stating your name has been denied by the Immortals,
you must choose a NEW, original medieval name.  To do this, you type:
 
"name <newname>"                 For example:  name Tsythia
 
Then pull the rope to announce your new name to the Immortals.  Give them
about 30 seconds to approve or deny the new name.  If you have not gotten
a response, pull the rope again.
 
The rope is on a 30 second timer, meaning you can pull it as often as you
wish, but the Immortals will only be notified once every 30 seconds.  The
Immortals are often busy and may not see you the first time around, so
please be patient - one will be with you as quickly as possible.

a much larger round tapestry hanging directly overhead, and you struggle

Desc     Do you wish to spend your time watching over your shoulder, hiding in the
shadows, killing and being killed by other players?
 
Pkill -- that is the decision you must make here.  If you so choose to walk
the path of shadows, killing and stealing from other players, you should be
aware that you may never again walk the path of light.  Once deadly, always
deadly.  As a deadly character you will be the potential victim all other
pkillers within FIVE levels (higher or lower) of your own.  You do not have
to decide to become pkill at this moment; you may embark upon that path at
any time in the future by requesting Immortal assistance, or by joining a
clan.  Both 'HELP RULES PKILL' and 'HELP RULES ASSIST' contain information
important to pkill players.  The gods forbid peaceful players to give much
in the way of assistance to pkillers.
 
- If you have read this and would like to walk the path of the deadly, type:
"say I choose to walk on the shadowy path of the pkillers."

- If you have read this and would like to remain on the peaceful path, type:
"say I choose to walk on the lighted path of the peaceful."

Flags    safe norecall nosummon noastral~
Desc     The dense mountains, almost impassable to begin, here bring the pathway to
a sheer end.  Tall bluffs rising to the east abruptly halt at a large gate,
gold in color.  The size of the gate and its obvious magical bestowments
give it the power to bar further passage into the world beyond until
unlocked by those who find its key.

of the cabin southwest of here has it.

Sector   inside~
Flags    indoors safe norecall nosummon noastral~
Desc     Dank musty air fills this room.  Fingers of darkness in the form of
several begrimed cobwebs cling to your face.  Every movement seems
to kick up long settled dust, making it nearly unbearable down here.
The creaking from above is magnified, changed, and lends a haunting
feel to this place.  Deep in the shadows is a small table, it holds
only one item:  a partially burned wooden box.  The trapdoor is up.
